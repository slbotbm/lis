I know, and you know, that were I\r\nonce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you\r\ndid my poor Lucy\u2019s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing\r\nthat stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the\r\nfriends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die\r\nin such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be\r\ndone, is God\u2019s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the\r\ncertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the\r\nblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!\u201d We were all\r\nsilent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The\r\nfaces of the others were set and Harker\u2019s grew ashen grey; perhaps he\r\nguessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:\u2014\n\u201cThis is what I can give into the hotch-pot.\u201d I could not but note the\r\nquaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all\r\nseriousness. \u201cWhat will each of you give? Your lives I know,\u201d she went\r\non quickly, \u201cthat is easy for brave men. Your lives are God\u2019s, and you\r\ncan give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?\u201d She looked\r\nagain questioningly, but this time avoided her husband\u2019s face. Quincey\r\nseemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. \u201cThen I shall tell\r\nyou plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this\r\nconnection between us now. You must promise me, one and all\u2014even you,\r\nmy beloved husband\u2014that, should the time come, you will kill me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that time?\u201d The voice was Quincey\u2019s, but it was low and\r\nstrained.\n\u201cWhen you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that\r\nI die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,\r\nwithout a moment\u2019s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;\r\nor do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!\u201d\nQuincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her\r\nand taking her hand in his said solemnly:\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019m only a rough fellow, who hasn\u2019t, perhaps, lived as a man should to\r\nwin such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and\r\ndear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty\r\nthat you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all\r\ncertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has\r\ncome!\u201d\n\u201cMy true friend!\u201d was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,\r\nbending over, she kissed his hand.\n\u201cI swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!\u201d said Van Helsing.\n\u201cAnd I!\u201d said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to\r\ntake the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her\r\nwan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of\r\nhis hair, and asked:\u2014\n\u201cAnd must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?\u201d\n\u201cYou too, my dearest,\u201d she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her\r\nvoice and eyes. \u201cYou must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and\r\nall the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all\r\ntime. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed\r\ntheir wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the\r\nhands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because\r\nthose that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men\u2019s duty\r\ntowards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my\r\ndear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at\r\nthe hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not\r\nforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy\u2019s case to him who loved\u201d\u2014she stopped\r\nwith a flying blush, and changed her phrase\u2014\u201cto him who had best right\r\nto give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make\r\nit a happy memory of my husband\u2019s life that it was his loving hand which\r\nset me free from the awful thrall upon me.\u201d\n\u201cAgain I swear!\u201d came the Professor\u2019s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker\r\nsmiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and\r\nsaid:\u2014\n\u201cAnd now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:\r\nthis time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in\r\nsuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a\r\ntime I myself might be\u2014nay! if the time ever comes, shall be\u2014leagued\r\nwith your enemy against you.\u201d\n\u201cOne more request;\u201d she became very solemn as she said this, \u201cit is not\r\nvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for\r\nme, if you will.\u201d We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need\r\nto speak:\u2014\n\u201cI want you to read the Burial Service.\u201d She was interrupted by a deep\r\ngroan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her\r\nheart, and continued: \u201cYou must read it over me some day. Whatever may\r\nbe the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet\r\nthought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for\r\nthen it will be in your voice in my memory for ever\u2014come what may!\u201d\n\u201cBut oh, my dear one,\u201d he pleaded, \u201cdeath is afar off from you.\u201d\n\u201cNay,\u201d she said, holding up a warning hand. \u201cI am deeper in death at\r\nthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!\u201d\n\u201cOh, my wife, must I read it?\u201d he said, before he began.\n\u201cIt would comfort me, my husband!\u201d was all she said; and he began to\r\nread when she had got the book ready.\n\u201cHow can I\u2014how could any one\u2014tell of that strange scene, its\r\nsolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its\r\nsweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter\r\ntruth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart\r\nhad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling\r\nround that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of\r\nher husband\u2019s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he\r\nhad to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial\r\nof the Dead. I\u2014I cannot go on\u2014words\u2014and\u2014v-voice\u2014f-fail m-me!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may\r\nhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it\r\ncomforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker\u2019s coming\r\nrelapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any\r\nof us as we had dreaded.\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\n15 October, Varna.\u2014We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,\r\ngot to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the\r\nOrient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five\r\no\u2019clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had\r\narrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel\u2014\u201cthe\r\nOdessus.\u201d The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager\r\nto get on, to care for them. Until the Czarina Catherine comes into\r\nport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.\r\nThank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is\r\ncoming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept\r\nnearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very\r\nwakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to\r\nhypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he\r\nhad to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by\r\nhabit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at\r\nthese particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He\r\nalways asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:\u2014\n\u201cNothing; all is dark.\u201d And to the second:\u2014\n\u201cI can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing\r\nby. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is\r\nhigh\u2014I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.\u201d\r\nIt is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on\r\nher way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four\r\ntelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:\r\nthat the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd\u2019s from\r\nanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should\r\nsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He\r\nwas to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be\r\nsure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.\nWe had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the\r\nVice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship\r\nas soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get\r\non the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the\r\nform of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and\r\nso cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man\u2019s form without\r\nsuspicion\u2014which he evidently wishes to avoid\u2014he must remain in the\r\nbox. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;\r\nfor we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,\r\nbefore he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for\r\nmuch. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the\r\nseamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,\r\nand we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the\r\nship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being\r\nwarned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I\r\nthink!\n\u00a0\n16 October.\u2014Mina\u2019s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing\r\nwater, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and\r\nwhen we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready. As she must\r\npass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.\n. . . . .\r\n. . . . .\r\n. . . . .\r\n. . . . .\r\n. . . . .\r\n. . . . .\r\n. . . . .\n17 October.\u2014Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome\r\nthe Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that\r\nhe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from\r\na friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own\r\nrisk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every\r\nfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a\r\nsimilar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who\r\nwas much impressed with Godalming\u2019s kindly manner to him, and we are all\r\nsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We\r\nhave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the\r\nCount is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and\r\ndrive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall\r\nprevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall\r\nhave ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count\u2019s body,\r\nit will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no\r\nevidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But\r\neven if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps\r\nsome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and\r\na rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it\r\nwere to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our\r\nintent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the\r\nCzarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a special\r\nmessenger.\n\u00a0\n24 October.\u2014A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,\r\nbut only the same story: \u201cNot yet reported.\u201d Mina\u2019s morning and evening\r\nhypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking\r\nmasts.\nTelegram, October 24th.\n\nRufus Smith, Lloyd\u2019s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.\r\nVice-Consul, Varna.\n\r\n\u201cCzarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles.\u201d\n\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n25 October.\u2014How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is\r\nirksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with\r\nexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd\u2019s. I\r\nknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.\r\nHarker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After\r\nall, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to\r\nlet her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any\r\nexcitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am\r\nsure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but\r\nin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The\r\nlethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is\r\ngetting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We\r\ntalk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It\r\nwould break poor Harker\u2019s heart\u2014certainly his nerve\u2014if he knew that we\r\nhad even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,\r\nher teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for\r\nhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active\r\ndanger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be\r\nnecessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to\r\nbe, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should\r\nneither of us shrink from the task\u2014awful though it be to contemplate.\r\n\u201cEuthanasia\u201d is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to\r\nwhoever invented it.\nIt is only about 24 hours\u2019 sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the\r\nrate the Czarina Catherine has come from London. She should therefore\r\narrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in\r\nbefore then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one\r\no\u2019clock, so as to be ready.\n\u00a0\n25 October, Noon.\u2014No news yet of the ship\u2019s arrival. Mrs. Harker\u2019s\r\nhypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible\r\nthat we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of\r\nexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and\r\nan hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife\r\nwhich he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the\r\nCount if the edge of that \u201cKukri\u201d ever touches his throat, driven by\r\nthat stern, ice-cold hand!\nVan Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About\r\nnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we\r\nkept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She\r\nhad been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know\r\nthat she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually\r\nthat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to\r\nher room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so\r\nwell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than\r\nanything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder\r\nthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.\n\u00a0\nLater.\u2014Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep\r\nof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had\r\nbeen for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he\r\nmay be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To\r\nhis doom, I trust!\n\u00a0\n26 October.\u2014Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine.\r\nShe ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying somewhere is\r\napparent, for Mrs. Harker\u2019s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the\r\nsame. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;\r\nsome of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog\r\nboth to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as\r\nthe ship may now be signalled any moment.\n\u00a0\n27 October, Noon.\u2014Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.\r\nMrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: \u201clapping\r\nwaves and rushing water,\u201d though she added that \u201cthe waves were very\r\nfaint.\u201d The telegrams from London have been the same: \u201cno further\r\nreport.\u201d Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he\r\nfears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:\u2014\n\u201cI did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina\u2019s. Souls and memories can do\r\nstrange things during trance.\u201d I was about to ask him more, but Harker\r\njust then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night\r\nat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.\n\u00a0\n28 October.\u2014Telegram. Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,\r\ncare H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna.\n\u201cCzarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o\u2019clock\r\nto-day.\u201d\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n28 October.\u2014When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I\r\ndo not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been\r\nexpected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would\r\ncome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.\r\nThe delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things\r\nwould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the\r\nchange would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose\r\nthat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against\r\nourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know\r\nthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if\r\nit be a will-o\u2019-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all\r\ntook it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a\r\nmoment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a\r\nword, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord\r\nGodalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half\r\nstunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris\r\ntightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our\r\nold wandering days it meant \u201caction.\u201d Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so\r\nthat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands\r\nmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled\u2014actually smiled\u2014the\r\ndark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his\r\naction belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of\r\nthe great Kukri knife and rested there. \u201cWhen does the next train start\r\nfor Galatz?\u201d said Van Helsing to us generally.\n\u201cAt 6:30 to-morrow morning!\u201d We all started, for the answer came from\r\nMrs. Harker.\n\u201cHow on earth do you know?\u201d said Art.\n\u201cYou forget\u2014or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so\r\ndoes Dr. Van Helsing\u2014that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I\r\nalways used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my\r\nhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\r\nthe time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\r\nDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\r\nlearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,\r\nas the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\u201d\n\u201cWonderful woman!\u201d murmured the Professor.\n\u201cCan\u2019t we get a special?\u201d asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his\r\nhead: \u201cI fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even\r\nif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\r\nregular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.\r\nNow let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\r\ntickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do\r\nyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\r\nletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\r\njust as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\r\nhis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\r\nsmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay\r\nwith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you\r\nmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\r\nwith Madam to make report.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\r\nhad been for many a long day, \u201cshall try to be of use in all ways, and\r\nshall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting\r\nfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\u201d\r\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\r\nrealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\r\neach other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the\r\ntime, however.\nWhen the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.\r\nHarker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\r\nHarker\u2019s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door\r\nwas shut upon her he said to me:\u2014\n\u201cWe mean the same! speak out!\u201d\n\u201cThere is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\r\ndeceive us.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d said I, \u201cunless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\u201d\n\u201cYou are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell\r\nyou something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great\u2014a terrible\u2014risk;\r\nbut I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those\r\nwords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In\r\nthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\r\nmind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\r\nwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn\r\nthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\r\neyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.\r\nNow he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.\n\u201cHe is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\r\nbut he cut her off\u2014take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\r\nso she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that\r\nhave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\r\ncome higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,\r\nthat grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and\r\ntherefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!\r\nShe know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when\r\nwe want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great\r\nbrain which is trained like man\u2019s brain, but is of sweet woman and have\r\na special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\r\naltogether\u2014though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall\r\nlearn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never\r\nfeared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!\u201d\nI thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\r\njust as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\r\nhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into\r\nthe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\r\nforgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\r\nof typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face\r\nbrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and\r\nthumb he said:\u2014\n\u201cFriend John, to you with so much of experience already\u2014and you, too,\r\ndear Madam Mina, that are young\u2014here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\r\nthink. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\r\nlet him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\r\nwhere that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought\r\nat all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\r\nstrong to use his little wings. Nay, like the \u201cUgly Duck\u201d of my friend\r\nHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\r\nsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I\r\nread here what Jonathan have written:\u2014\n\u201cThat other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\r\nhis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\r\nbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\r\nalone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\r\nsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count\u2019s child-thought see\r\nnothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my\r\nman-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word\r\nfrom some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what\r\nit mean\u2014what it might mean. Just as there are elements which rest,\r\nyet when in nature\u2019s course they move on their way and they touch\u2014then\r\npouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill\r\nand destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and\r\nleagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever\r\nstudy the philosophy of crime? \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No.\u2019 You, John, yes; for it is\r\na study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not\u2014not\r\nbut once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad\r\nuniversale. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,\r\nin all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much\r\nfrom philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is. That is to\r\nbe empiric. The criminal always work at one crime\u2014that is the true\r\ncriminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.\r\nThis criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and\r\nresourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of\r\nchild-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime\r\nalso; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he\r\nhave done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not\r\nby principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to\r\nhim the ground to start from to do more. \u2018Dos pou sto,\u2019 said\r\nArchimedes. \u2018Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!\u2019 To do once,\r\nis the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have\r\nthe purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,\r\njust as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are\r\nopened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,\u201d for\r\nMrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:\u2014\n\u201cNow you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\r\nthose so bright eyes.\u201d He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.\r\nHis finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\r\nunconsciously, as she spoke:\u2014\n\u201cThe Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would\r\nso classify him, and qu\u00e2 criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.\r\nThus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a\r\nclue, and the one page of it that we know\u2014and that from his own\r\nlips\u2014tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a\r\n\u2018tight place,\u2019 he went back to his own country from the land he had\r\ntried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\r\nfor a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.\r\nSo he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all\r\nhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\r\nthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\r\nfrom Turkey Land.\u201d\n\u201cGood, good! oh, you so clever lady!\u201d said Van Helsing,\r\nenthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he\r\nsaid to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room\r\nconsultation:\u2014\n\u201cSeventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.\u201d Turning to\r\nher again, he said with keen expectation:\u2014\n\u201cBut go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;\r\nJohn and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.\r\nSpeak, without fear!\u201d\n\u201cI will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\u201d\n\u201cNay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\u201d\n\u201cThen, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\r\nand his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\r\npurpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,\r\nleaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\r\nsafe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat\r\nfrom the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful\r\nnight. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul\r\nis freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me\r\nis a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for\r\nhis ends.\u201d The Professor stood up:\u2014\n\u201cHe has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\r\nwhilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\r\nGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.\r\nBut his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in\r\nGod\u2019s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for\r\nhis selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken\r\nin his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he\r\nis free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so\r\nmany hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to\r\nsleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,\r\nthere can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That\r\nterrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him\r\nin spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the\r\nsun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;\r\nand this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your\r\nsuffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know\r\nit not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his\r\nknowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe\r\nthat God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark\r\nhours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril\r\nourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great\r\nhour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe\r\nand write him all down, so that when the others return from their work\r\nyou can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.\u201d\nAnd so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker\r\nhas written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.\n29 October.\u2014This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last\r\nnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us\r\nhad done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,\r\nand opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and\r\nfor our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.\r\nHarker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\r\nmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\r\nnecessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but\r\nthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\r\nresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:\u2014\n\u201cI can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a\r\nsteady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear\r\nmen\u2019s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\r\nthe rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.\r\nThere is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged\r\nalong. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\r\nblowing upon me.\u201d\nHere she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\r\non the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a\r\nweight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.\r\nQuincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\r\nHarker\u2019s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There\r\nwas a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was\r\npassing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she\r\nsat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:\u2014\n\u201cWould none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!\u201d We\r\ncould only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get\r\ntea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:\u2014\n\u201cYou see, my friends. He is close to land: he has left his\r\nearth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie\r\nhidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do\r\nnot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be\r\nin the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did\r\nat Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he\r\nbe carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men\r\nmay discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on\r\nshore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.\r\nWe may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come\r\non him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his\r\ntrue self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.\u201d\nThere was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;\r\nat which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.\nEarly this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\r\nresponse in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\r\nthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was\r\nso short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole\r\nsoul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\r\nreply:\u2014\n\u201cAll is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\r\nof wood on wood.\u201d She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till\r\nto-night.\nAnd so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of\r\nexpectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;\r\nbut already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot\r\npossibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more\r\nhypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw\r\nmore light on what is happening.\n\u00a0\nLater.\u2014Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when\r\nthere was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a\r\nstation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.\r\nMrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than\r\nthis morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count\u2019s\r\nsensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that\r\nher imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance\r\nhitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes\r\non it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count\u2019s power\r\nover her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be\r\na happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did\r\nspeak, her words were enigmatical:\u2014\n\u201cSomething is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can\r\nhear, far off, confused sounds\u2014as of men talking in strange tongues,\r\nfierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.\u201d She stopped and a\r\nshudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,\r\ntill, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even\r\nin answer to the Professor\u2019s imperative questioning. When she woke from\r\nthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was\r\nall alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;\r\nwhen she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in\r\nsilence.\n\u00a0\n30 October, 7 a. m.\u2014We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time\r\nto write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.\r\nKnowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,\r\nVan Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no\r\neffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still\r\ngreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor\r\nlost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:\u2014\n\u201cAll is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the\r\ncreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a\r\nqueer one like\u2014\u2014\u201d She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.\n\u201cGo on; go on! Speak, I command you!\u201d said Van Helsing in an agonised\r\nvoice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun\r\nwas reddening even Mrs. Harker\u2019s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we\r\nall started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost\r\nunconcern:\u2014\n\u201cOh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can\u2019t? I don\u2019t remember\r\nanything.\u201d Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,\r\nturning from one to the other with a troubled look:\u2014\n\u201cWhat have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was\r\nlying here, half asleep, and heard you say \u2018go on! speak, I command you!\u2019\r\nIt seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad\r\nchild!\u201d\n\u201cOh, Madam Mina,\u201d he said, sadly, \u201cit is proof, if proof be needed, of\r\nhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more\r\nearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I\r\nam proud to obey!\u201d\nThe whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with\r\nanxiety and eagerness.\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\n30 October.\u2014Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been\r\nordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since\r\nhe does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed\r\nmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the\r\nVice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some\r\nsort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two\r\ndoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival\r\nof the Czarina Catherine.\n\u00a0\nLater.\u2014Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the\r\nVice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.\r\nHe was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.\nJonathan Harker\u2019s Journal.\n30 October.\u2014At nine o\u2019clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called\r\non Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of\r\nHapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord\r\nGodalming\u2019s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in\r\ntheir power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once\r\non board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river\r\nharbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his\r\nvoyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a\r\nrun.\n\u201cMan!\u201d he said, \u201cbut it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should\r\nhave to pay for it wi\u2019 some rare piece o\u2019 ill luck, so as to keep up the\r\naverage. It\u2019s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi\u2019 a wind\r\nahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin\u2019 on yer sail for his\r\nain purpose. An\u2019 a\u2019 the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh\r\na ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi\u2019 us,\r\ntill when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could\r\nwe see. We ran by Gibraltar wi\u2019oot bein\u2019 able to signal; an\u2019 till we\r\ncame to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we\r\nnever were within hail o\u2019 aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail\r\nand beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the\r\nDeil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it\r\nwhether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our\r\nmiscredit wi\u2019 the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an\u2019 the Old Mon who\r\nhad served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no\r\nhinderin\u2019 him.\u201d This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition\r\nand commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:\u2014\n\u201cMine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and\r\nhe know when he meet his match!\u201d The skipper was not displeased with the\r\ncompliment, and went on:\u2014\n\u201cWhen we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o\u2019 them,\r\nthe Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had\r\nbeen put on board by a queer lookin\u2019 old man just before we had started\r\nfrae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa\r\nfingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the\r\nsupersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot\r\ntheir business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I\r\nfelt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn\u2019t say it was\r\nagin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn\u2019t let up for\r\nfive days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get\r\nsomewheres\u2014well, he would fetch it up a\u2019reet. An\u2019 if he didn\u2019t, well,\r\nwe\u2019d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and\r\ndeep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin\u2019 sun came\r\nthrough the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.\r\nThe Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the\r\nbox and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi\u2019 them aboot it wi\u2019 a\r\nhandspike; an\u2019 when the last o\u2019 them rose off the deck wi\u2019 his head in\r\nhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the\r\nproperty and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the\r\nriver Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to\r\nfling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I\u2019d let it\r\nlie till we discharged in the port an\u2019 get rid o\u2019t althegither. We\r\ndidn\u2019t do much clearin\u2019 that day, an\u2019 had to remain the nicht at anchor;\r\nbut in the mornin\u2019, braw an\u2019 airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came\r\naboard wi\u2019 an order, written to him from England, to receive a box\r\nmarked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to\r\nhis hand. He had his papers a\u2019 reet, an\u2019 glad I was to be rid o\u2019 the\r\ndam\u2019 thing, for I was beginnin\u2019 masel\u2019 to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil\r\ndid have any luggage aboord the ship, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it was nane ither\r\nthan that same!\u201d\n\u201cWhat was the name of the man who took it?\u201d asked Dr. Van Helsing with\r\nrestrained eagerness.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be tellin\u2019 ye quick!\u201d he answered, and, stepping down to his\r\ncabin, produced a receipt signed \u201cImmanuel Hildesheim.\u201d Burgen-strasse\r\n16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so\r\nwith thanks we came away.\nWe found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi\r\nTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were\r\npointed with specie\u2014we doing the punctuation\u2014and with a little\r\nbargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but\r\nimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling\r\nhim to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box\r\nwhich would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. This he was to\r\ngive in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks\r\nwho traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by\r\nan English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube\r\nInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to\r\nthe ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all\r\nhe knew.\nWe then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his\r\nneighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had\r\ngone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by\r\nhis landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house\r\ntogether with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten\r\nand eleven o\u2019clock last night. We were at a standstill again.\nWhilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that\r\nthe body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of\r\nSt. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild\r\nanimal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the\r\nwomen crying out \u201cThis is the work of a Slovak!\u201d We hurried away lest we\r\nshould have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.\nAs we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all\r\nconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where\r\nthat might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home\r\nto the hotel to Mina.\nWhen we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina\r\nagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at\r\nleast a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was\r\nreleased from my promise to her.\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\n30 October, evening.\u2014They were so tired and worn out and dispirited\r\nthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked\r\nthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything\r\nup to the moment.

He evidently fears discovery or\r\ninterference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be\u2014confined\r\nas he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.\n(b) How is he to be taken?\u2014Here a process of exclusions may help\r\nus. By road, by rail, by water?\n1. By Road.\u2014There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the\r\ncity.\n(x) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,\r\na surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.\n(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.\n(z) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order\r\nto prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even\r\nhis victim\u2014me!\n2. By Rail.\u2014There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to\r\ntake its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies\r\non the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if\r\nleft in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not\r\nwhat he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.\n3. By Water.\u2014Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most\r\ndanger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even\r\nthen he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were\r\nhe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would\r\nindeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were\r\nunfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would\r\nstill be desperate.\nWe know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do\r\nis to ascertain what water.\nThe first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,\r\nthen, get a light on what his later task is to be.\nFirstly.\u2014We must differentiate between what he did in London as part\r\nof his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had\r\nto arrange as best he could.\nSecondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we\r\nknow of, what he has done here.\nAs to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent\r\ninvoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of\r\nexit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.\r\nThe proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel\r\nHildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise. There is\r\nalso the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but\r\nthere must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to\r\nHildesheim", "summary": "\nThe narrative continues with Mina Harker making a solemn request of the group. She asks them all to promise that, should she become fully transformed into a vampire, they will kill her without hesitation. Though reluctant, they all swear to grant her this mercy, even Jonathan, who struggles most with the promise. She also requests they read the Burial Service over her, which Jonathan performs in a deeply moving scene.\nThe group travels to Varna to intercept Dracula, tracking the Czarina Catherine, the ship carrying him and his last earth box. While awaiting the ship's arrival, Van Helsing continues to hypnotize Mina at sunrise and sunset, when she can sense what Dracula experiences. Through these sessions, they monitor the vampire's journey, hearing descriptions of waves lapping against the ship and sailors moving above. Mina's trances become increasingly difficult to induce, and the group notices subtle changes in her appearance\u2014signs of the vampire's blood taking effect.\nUnexpectedly, they receive news that the Czarina Catherine has bypassed Varna and docked at Galatz instead. The group quickly changes plans, arranging to travel there by train. Van Helsing privately explains to Dr. Seward his theory that Dracula has severed his mental connection with Mina to prevent her from revealing his plans, which has inadvertently freed her somewhat from his influence.\nUpon reaching Galatz, they investigate the ship and learn that Dracula's box was collected before sunrise by an agent named Immanuel Hildesheim, who transferred it to a Slovak trader named Petrof Skinsky. They discover Skinsky has been murdered with his throat torn open, suggesting Dracula has fed and is now moving the box inland. The trail temporarily goes cold.\nDuring a rest period, Mina applies her analytical skills to the problem. She methodically evaluates Dracula's transportation options\u2014road, rail, or water\u2014concluding that water travel offers him the best combination of safety and mobility despite its limitations. She notes that by water he is powerless during daylight but can summon fog, storms, and wolves at night. She also deduces that Dracula deliberately misled them by sending the ship to Varna in shipping documents while actually directing it to Galatz.\nThroughout these developments, the group witnesses Mina's deteriorating condition. She experiences periods of lethargy and mental confusion, though at sunrise and sunset she briefly returns to her normal self. These episodes become shorter and less frequent, intensifying the urgency of their hunt. Despite her condition, Mina remains an invaluable member of the team, using her organizational skills and intelligence to help track the vampire even as she fears the growing influence he has over her.\nThe narrative builds toward the final confrontation, with the hunters racing to intercept Dracula before he reaches his castle in Transylvania, where he would be nearly impossible to defeat. Their goal remains to destroy him while he's vulnerable during transit, trapped in his earth box between sunrise and sunset.\n", "map": [["Mina's death pact request", "Ultimate sacrifice for salvation"], ["Hypnotic connection to Dracula", "Tactical advantage with diminishing returns"], ["Vampire blood's gradual transformation", "Progressive loss of humanity"], ["Sunrise and sunset clarity", "Windows of authentic consciousness"], ["Dracula's strategic misdirection", "Exploitation of expectation patterns"], ["Water travel limitations", "Defined vampire vulnerability boundaries"], ["Murder of intermediaries", "Blood trail marking Dracula's path"], ["Earth box transit period", "Critical window for destruction"], ["Mina's analytical reasoning", "Resistance against vampiric corruption"], ["Race toward Transylvania", "Narrowing opportunity for victory"]]}
