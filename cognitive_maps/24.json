And together we went into the room.\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van\r\nHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I\r\nheard the Professor\u2019s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a\r\ndeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and\r\nhis exclamation of horror, \u201cGott in Himmel!\u201d needed no enforcement from\r\nhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his\r\niron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly\r\nwhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums\r\nseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a\r\ncorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp\r\nin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit\r\nstood to him, and he put it down again softly. \u201cQuick!\u201d he said. \u201cBring\r\nthe brandy.\u201d I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.\r\nHe wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and\r\nwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising\r\nsuspense said:\u2014\n\u201cIt is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is\r\nundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have\r\nto call on you yourself this time, friend John.\u201d As he spoke, he was\r\ndipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I\r\nhad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no\r\npossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,\r\nwithout a moment\u2019s delay, we began the operation. After a time\u2014it did\r\nnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one\u2019s blood, no\r\nmatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling\u2014Van Helsing\r\nheld up a warning finger. \u201cDo not stir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I fear that with\r\ngrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much\r\ndanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection\r\nof morphia.\u201d He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his\r\nintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge\r\nsubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride\r\nthat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid\r\ncheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to\r\nfeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\nThe Professor watched me critically. \u201cThat will do,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready?\u201d\r\nI remonstrated. \u201cYou took a great deal more from Art.\u201d To which he\r\nsmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:\u2014\n\u201cHe is her lover, her fianc\u00e9. You have work, much work, to do for her\r\nand for others; and the present will suffice.\u201d\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\r\ndigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his\r\nleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by\r\nhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for\r\nmyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\r\nwhispered:\u2014\n\u201cMind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up\r\nunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and\r\nenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!\u201d\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:\u2014\n\u201cYou are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and\r\nrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.\u201d\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I\r\nhad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I\r\nfelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\r\nwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\r\nand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\r\nshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to\r\nshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,\r\nsleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\r\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\r\nedges\u2014tiny though they were.\nLucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and\r\nstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing\r\nhad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict\r\ninjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his\r\nvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything\r\nhad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother\r\ncame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\r\nsaid to me gratefully:\u2014\n\u201cWe owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\r\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale\r\nyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\r\ndo!\u201d As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\r\nfor her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\r\ndrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\r\nimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\r\nlips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\r\n\u201cNow you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I\r\nstay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and\r\nI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave\r\nreasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think\r\neven the most not-probable. Good-night.\u201d\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of\r\nthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and\r\nwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing\u2019s wish that either he or I should sit\r\nup, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the \u201cforeign\r\ngentleman.\u201d I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because\r\nI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy\u2019s account, that\r\ntheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen\r\nsimilar instances of woman\u2019s kindness. I got back here in time for a\r\nlate dinner; went my rounds\u2014all well; and set this down whilst waiting\r\nfor sleep. It is coming.\n\u00a0\n11 September.\u2014This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van\r\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had\r\narrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it\r\nwith much impressment\u2014assumed, of course\u2014and showed a great bundle of\r\nwhite flowers.\n\u201cThese are for you, Miss Lucy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!\u201d\n\u201cYes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.\u201d Here\r\nLucy made a wry face. \u201cNay, but they are not to take in a decoction or\r\nin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall\r\npoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing\r\nso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,\r\nthat bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but\r\nyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and\r\nhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the\r\nlotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters\r\nof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought\r\nfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late.\u201d\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling\r\nthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and\r\nhalf-disgust:\u2014\n\u201cOh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\r\nthese flowers are only common garlic.\u201d\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\r\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:\u2014\n\u201cNo trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;\r\nand I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\r\nothers if not for your own.\u201d Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\r\nwell be, he went on more gently: \u201cOh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\r\nme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\r\ncommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\r\nwreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\r\ninquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\r\nand obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\r\nfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall\r\nhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,\r\nwhere my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.\r\nI had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.\u201d\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor\u2019s\r\nactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacop\u0153ia\r\nthat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\r\nsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\r\nthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\r\nin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\r\nall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\r\nthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\r\npresently I said:\u2014\n\u201cWell, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\r\nthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\r\nwould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I am!\u201d he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\r\nLucy was to wear round her neck.\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\r\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\r\nneck. The last words he said to her were:\u2014\n\u201cTake care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\r\nnot to-night open the window or the door.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cand thank you both a thousand times for all\r\nyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such\r\nfriends?\u201d\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:\u2014\n\u201cTo-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want\u2014two nights of travel,\r\nmuch reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,\r\nand a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early\r\nyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\r\nmore strong for my \u2018spell\u2019 which I have work. Ho! ho!\u201d\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights\r\nbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must\r\nhave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but\r\nI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.\nLucy Westenra\u2019s Diary.\n12 September.\u2014How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.\r\nVan Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He\r\npositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been\r\nright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread\r\nbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not\r\nmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I\r\nhave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,\r\nor the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has\r\nfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no\r\ndreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings\r\nnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,\r\nand lying like Ophelia in the play, with \u201cvirgin crants and maiden\r\nstrewments.\u201d I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!\r\nThere is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,\r\neverybody.\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n13 September.\u2014Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,\r\nup to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The\r\nProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at\r\neight o\u2019clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the\r\nfresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature\u2019s\r\nannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,\r\nbut had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met\r\nMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early\r\nriser. She greeted us warmly and said:\u2014\n\u201cYou will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still\r\nasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I\r\nshould disturb her.\u201d The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He\r\nrubbed his hands together, and said:\u2014\n\u201cAha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,\u201d to\r\nwhich she answered:\u2014\n\u201cYou must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy\u2019s state this\r\nmorning is due in part to me.\u201d\n\u201cHow you do mean, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked the Professor.\n\u201cWell, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into\r\nher room. She was sleeping soundly\u2014so soundly that even my coming did\r\nnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\r\nhorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\r\na bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\r\ntoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\r\nand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be\r\npleased with her, I am sure.\u201d\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As\r\nshe had spoken, I watched the Professor\u2019s face, and saw it turn ashen\r\ngrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\r\nwas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\r\nhe actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\r\nher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and\r\nforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.\nThen, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He\r\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat\r\nhis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\r\nand putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\r\nthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\r\nhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. \u201cGod! God!\r\nGod!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\r\nwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the\r\npagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor\r\nmother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such\r\nthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we\r\nmust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are\r\nbeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!\u201d Suddenly he\r\njumped to his feet. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201ccome, we must see and act. Devils\r\nor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him\r\nall the same.\u201d He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we\r\nwent up to Lucy\u2019s room.\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.\r\nThis time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same\r\nawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and\r\ninfinite pity.\n\u201cAs I expected,\u201d he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which\r\nmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then\r\nbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another\r\noperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the\r\nnecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\r\nwarning hand. \u201cNo!\u201d he said. \u201cTo-day you must operate. I shall provide.\r\nYou are weakened already.\u201d As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled\r\nup his shirt-sleeve.\nAgain the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to\r\nthe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I\r\nwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must\r\nnot remove anything from Lucy\u2019s room without consulting him; that the\r\nflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour\r\nwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case\r\nhimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would\r\nsend me word when to come.\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and\r\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\nWhat does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life\r\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.\nLucy Westenra\u2019s Diary.\n17 September.\u2014Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong\r\nagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some\r\nlong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and\r\nfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim\r\nhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness\r\nin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress\r\nmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to\r\nlife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,\r\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems\r\nto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my\r\nwits\u2014the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed\r\nso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and\r\ncommanded me to do I know not what\u2014have all ceased. I go to bed now\r\nwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown\r\nquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from\r\nHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a\r\nday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left\r\nalone. Thank God for mother\u2019s sake, and dear Arthur\u2019s, and for all our\r\nfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for\r\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found\r\nhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,\r\nalthough the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against\r\nthe window-panes.\n\u201cThe Pall Mall Gazette,\u201d 18 September.\n\r\nTHE ESCAPED WOLF.\n\nPERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.\nInterview with the Keeper in the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens.\nAfter many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using\r\nthe words \u201cPall Mall Gazette\u201d as a sort of talisman, I managed to find\r\nthe keeper of the section of the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens in which the wolf\r\ndepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in\r\nthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to\r\nhis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,\r\nelderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their\r\nhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty\r\ncomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called \u201cbusiness\u201d\r\nuntil the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the\r\ntable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:\u2014\n\u201cNow, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You\u2019ll excoose me\r\nrefoosin\u2019 to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the\r\nwolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore\r\nI begins to arsk them questions.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you mean, ask them questions?\u201d I queried, wishful to get him\r\ninto a talkative humour.\n\u201c\u2019Ittin\u2019 of them over the \u2019ead with a pole is one way; scratchin\u2019 of\r\ntheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf\r\nto their gals. I don\u2019t so much mind the fust\u2014the \u2019ittin\u2019 with a pole\r\nafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they\u2019ve \u2019ad their\r\nsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the\r\near-scratchin\u2019. Mind you,\u201d he added philosophically, \u201cthere\u2019s a deal of\r\nthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here\u2019s you a-comin\u2019 and\r\narskin\u2019 of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that\r\nonly for your bloomin\u2019 \u2019arf-quid I\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 seen you blowed fust \u2019fore I\u2019d\r\nanswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I\u2019d like you to\r\narsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence\r\ndid I tell yer to go to \u2019ell?\u201d\n\u201cYou did.\u201d\n\u201cAn\u2019 when you said you\u2019d report me for usin\u2019 of obscene language that\r\nwas \u2019ittin\u2019 me over the \u2019ead; but the \u2019arf-quid made that all right. I\r\nweren\u2019t a-goin\u2019 to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my \u2019owl\r\nas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor\u2019 love yer \u2019art, now\r\nthat the old \u2019ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an\u2019 rinsed\r\nme out with her bloomin\u2019 old teapot, and I\u2019ve lit hup, you may scratch\r\nmy ears for all you\u2019re worth, and won\u2019t git even a growl out of me.\r\nDrive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin\u2019 at, that \u2019ere\r\nescaped wolf.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it\r\nhappened; and when I know the facts I\u2019ll get you to say what you\r\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will\r\nend.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, guv\u2019nor. This \u2019ere is about the \u2019ole story. That \u2019ere wolf\r\nwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from\r\nNorway to Jamrach\u2019s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a\r\nnice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I\u2019m more\r\nsurprised at \u2019im for wantin\u2019 to get out nor any other animile in the\r\nplace. But, there, you can\u2019t trust wolves no more nor women.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mind him, sir!\u201d broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \u201c\u2019E\u2019s\r\ngot mindin\u2019 the animiles so long that blest if he ain\u2019t like a old wolf\r\n\u2019isself! But there ain\u2019t no \u2019arm in \u2019im.\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, it was about two hours after feedin\u2019 yesterday when I first\r\nhear my disturbance. I was makin\u2019 up a litter in the monkey-house for a\r\nyoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin\u2019 and \u2019owlin\u2019 I kem\r\naway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin\u2019 like a mad thing at the\r\nbars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn\u2019t much people about that\r\nday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a \u2019ook\r\nnose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin\u2019 through it. He\r\nhad a \u2019ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,\r\nfor it seemed as if it was \u2019im as they was hirritated at. He \u2019ad white\r\nkid gloves on \u2019is \u2019ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:\r\n\u2018Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Maybe it\u2019s you,\u2019 says I, for I did not like the airs as he give\r\n\u2019isself. He didn\u2019t git angry, as I \u2019oped he would, but he smiled a kind\r\nof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. \u2018Oh no, they\r\nwouldn\u2019t like me,\u2019 \u2019e says.\n\u201c\u2018Ow yes, they would,\u2019 says I, a-imitatin\u2019 of him. \u2018They always likes a\r\nbone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you \u2019as a\r\nbagful.\u2019\n\u201cWell, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin\u2019 they\r\nlay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears\r\nsame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn\u2019t put\r\nin his hand and stroke the old wolf\u2019s ears too!\n\u201c\u2018Tyke care,\u2019 says I. \u2018Bersicker is quick.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Never mind,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019m used to \u2019em!\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Are you in the business yourself?\u2019 I says, tyking off my \u2019at, for a\r\nman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 says he, \u2018not exactly in the business, but I \u2019ave made pets of\r\nseveral.\u2019 And with that he lifts his \u2019at as perlite as a lord, and walks\r\naway. Old Bersicker kep\u2019 a-lookin\u2019 arter \u2019im till \u2019e was out of sight,\r\nand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn\u2019t come hout the \u2019ole\r\nhevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves\r\nhere all began a-\u2019owling. There warn\u2019t nothing for them to \u2019owl at.\r\nThere warn\u2019t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin\u2019 a\r\ndog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice\r\nI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the \u2019owling\r\nstopped. Just before twelve o\u2019clock I just took a look round afore\r\nturnin\u2019 in, an\u2019, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker\u2019s\r\ncage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And\r\nthat\u2019s all I know for certing.\u201d\n\u201cDid any one else see anything?\u201d\n\u201cOne of our gard\u2019ners was a-comin\u2019 \u2019ome about that time from a \u2019armony,\r\nwhen he sees a big grey dog comin\u2019 out through the garding \u2019edges. At\r\nleast, so he says, but I don\u2019t give much for it myself, for if he did \u2019e\r\nnever said a word about it to his missis when \u2019e got \u2019ome, and it was\r\nonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all\r\nnight-a-huntin\u2019 of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein\u2019\r\nanything. My own belief was that the \u2019armony \u2019ad got into his \u2019ead.\u201d\n\u201cNow, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the\r\nwolf?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \u201cI think I can;\r\nbut I don\u2019t know as \u2019ow you\u2019d be satisfied with the theory.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from\r\nexperience, can\u2019t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?\u201d\n\u201cWell then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that \u2019ere\r\nwolf escaped\u2014simply because he wanted to get out.\u201d\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I\r\ncould see that it had done service before, and that the whole\r\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn\u2019t cope in badinage\r\nwith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,\r\nso I said:\u2014\n\u201cNow, Mr. Bilder, we\u2019ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,\r\nand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you\u2019ve told me\r\nwhat you think will happen.\u201d\n\u201cRight y\u2019are, sir,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cYe\u2019ll excoose me, I know, for\r\na-chaffin\u2019 of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much\r\nas telling me to go on.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I never!\u201d said the old lady.\n\u201cMy opinion is this: that \u2019ere wolf is a-\u2019idin\u2019 of, somewheres. The\r\ngard\u2019ner wot didn\u2019t remember said he was a-gallopin\u2019 northward faster\r\nthan a horse could go; but I don\u2019t believe him, for, yer see, sir,\r\nwolves don\u2019t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein\u2019 built that\r\nway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets\r\nin packs and does be chivyin\u2019 somethin\u2019 that\u2019s more afeared than they is\r\nthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,\r\nLor\u2019 bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so\r\nclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in\r\n\u2019im. This one ain\u2019t been used to fightin\u2019 or even to providin\u2019 for\r\nhisself, and more like he\u2019s somewhere round the Park a-\u2019idin\u2019 an\u2019\r\na-shiverin\u2019 of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin\u2019 where he is to get\r\nhis breakfast from; or maybe he\u2019s got down some area and is in a\r\ncoal-cellar. My eye, won\u2019t some cook get a rum start when she sees his\r\ngreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can\u2019t get food he\u2019s\r\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher\u2019s\r\nshop in time. If he doesn\u2019t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin\u2019 orf with\r\na soldier, leavin\u2019 of the hinfant in the perambulator\u2014well, then I\r\nshouldn\u2019t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That\u2019s\r\nall.\u201d\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\r\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder\u2019s face doubled its natural length\r\nwith surprise.\n\u201cGod bless me!\u201d he said. \u201cIf there ain\u2019t old Bersicker come back by\r\n\u2019isself!\u201d\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it\r\nseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so\r\nwell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a\r\npersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor\r\nhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal\r\nitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all\r\npicture-wolves\u2014Red Riding Hood\u2019s quondam friend, whilst moving her\r\nconfidence in masquerade.\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The\r\nwicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the\r\nchildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of\r\npenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine\r\nprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\r\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:\u2014\n\u201cThere, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;\r\ndidn\u2019t I say it all along? Here\u2019s his head all cut and full of broken\r\nglass. \u2019E\u2019s been a-gettin\u2019 over some bloomin\u2019 wall or other. It\u2019s a\r\nshyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.\r\nThis \u2019ere\u2019s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.\u201d\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that\r\nsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the\r\nfatted calf, and went off to report.\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given\r\nto-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n17 September.\u2014I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my\r\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,\r\nhad fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in\r\nrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was\r\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\r\ninto the Superintendent\u2019s study is almost unknown. Without an instant\u2019s\r\npause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,\r\nas I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was\r\ntoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my\r\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.\r\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was\r\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a\r\nlittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not\r\nintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,\r\nkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the\r\nattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment\r\npositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking\r\nup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was\r\neasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite\r\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: \u201cThe blood is the life!\r\nThe blood is the life!\u201d\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of\r\nlate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy\u2019s\r\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and\r\nweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned\r\nme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without\r\nit.\nTelegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax.\n\r\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by\r\ntwenty-two hours.)\n\u201c17 September.\u2014Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not\r\nwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as\r\nplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as\r\npossible after arrival.\u201d\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n18 September.\u2014Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van\r\nHelsing\u2019s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know\r\nby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is\r\npossible that all may be well, but what may have happened? Surely\r\nthere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident\r\nshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with\r\nme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy\u2019s phonograph.\nMemorandum left by Lucy Westenra.\n17 September. Night.\u2014I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no\r\none may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact\r\nrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and\r\nhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the\r\ndoing.\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.\r\nVan Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that\r\nsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I\r\nknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in\r\nthe next room\u2014as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be\u2014so that I might have\r\ncalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me\r\nthe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep\r\nwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be\r\nalone, I opened my door and called out: \u201cIs there anybody there?\u201d There\r\nwas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.\r\nThen outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog\u2019s, but\r\nmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could\r\nsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its\r\nwings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined\r\nnot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;\r\nseeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She\r\nsaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:\u2014\n\u201cI was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all\r\nright.\u201d\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in\r\nand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did\r\nnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while\r\nand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in\r\nhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was\r\nstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I tried\r\nto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could\r\nhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was\r\nthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a\r\ncrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\r\nThe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the\r\naperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey\r\nwolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting\r\nposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst\r\nother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing\r\ninsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a\r\nsecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange\r\nand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over\u2014as if struck\r\nwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a\r\nmoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my\r\neyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole\r\nmyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken\r\nwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that\r\ntravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to\r\nstir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother\u2019s poor body,\r\nwhich seemed to grow cold already\u2014for her dear heart had ceased to\r\nbeat\u2014weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered\r\nconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the\r\ndogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,\r\nseemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and\r\nstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the\r\nnightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort\r\nme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear\r\ntheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they\r\ncame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay\r\nover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\r\nbroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my\r\ndear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\r\nhad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them\r\nto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew\r\nopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went\r\nin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear\r\nmother\u2019s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing\r\nhad told me, but I didn\u2019t like to remove them, and, besides, I would\r\nhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that\r\nthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went\r\nto the dining-room to look for them.\nMy heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless\r\non the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table\r\nhalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,\r\nand examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the\r\nsideboard, I found that the bottle which mother\u2019s doctor uses for\r\nher\u2014oh! did use\u2014was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back\r\nin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for\r\nthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I\r\ndare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the\r\nbroken window.\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from\r\nthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God\r\nshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,\r\nwhere they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother\r\ngone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not\r\nsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!\n18 September.\u2014I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\r\nKeeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\r\nand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\r\nmother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\r\nfinding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\r\nthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\r\nhour\u2014for it was now ten o\u2019clock\u2014and so rang and knocked again, but\r\nmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\r\nthe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\r\ndesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\r\ntight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\r\nlate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\r\ndanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\r\nand I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\r\nanywhere.\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\r\nlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\r\nrapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse\u2019s feet. They stopped at the\r\ngate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\r\nWhen he saw me, he gasped out:\u2014\n\u201cThen it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\r\nnot get my telegram?\u201d\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\r\ntelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\r\nand that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\r\nraised his hat as he said solemnly:\u2014\n\u201cThen I fear we are too late. God\u2019s will be done!\u201d With his usual\r\nrecuperative energy, he went on: \u201cCome. If there be no way open to get\r\nin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\u201d\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\r\nwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\r\nhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\r\nattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\r\nwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\r\nopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\r\nwas no one in the kitchen or in the servants\u2019 rooms, which were close at\r\nhand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\r\ndimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\r\nservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\r\nfor their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\r\nroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\r\neach other, and as we moved away he said: \u201cWe can attend to them later.\u201d\r\nThen we ascended to Lucy\u2019s room. For an instant or two we paused at the\r\ndoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\r\nfaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\r\nroom.\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\r\nmother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\r\nsheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\r\nbroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\r\nfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\r\ndrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\r\nmother\u2019s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\r\nwhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\r\nWithout a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\r\npoor Lucy\u2019s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\r\nlistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:\u2014\n\u201cIt is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\u201d\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\r\nit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\r\non the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\r\nfancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\r\nbut returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\r\noccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\r\nhands. He said to me:\u2014\n\u201cI can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\r\nFlick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\r\nget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\r\nthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\r\nmore.\u201d\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\r\nwomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\r\naffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\r\nsleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\r\nthem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\r\nthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\r\nwas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\r\nMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\r\nas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\r\nboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\r\ngot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\r\nwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\r\nof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\r\nshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\r\nwith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\r\nmust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\r\nand, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\r\nearnest. I knew\u2014as he knew\u2014that it was a stand-up fight with death,\r\nand in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\r\nunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:\u2014\n\u201cIf that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\r\naway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\u201d He went\r\non with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\r\nbe of some effect. Lucy\u2019s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\r\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing\u2019s\r\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\r\na hot sheet to dry her he said to me:\u2014\n\u201cThe first gain is ours! Check to the King!\u201d\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\r\nher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\r\nthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\r\nstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\r\never seen her.\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\r\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\r\nout of the room.\n\u201cWe must consult as to what is to be done,\u201d he said as we descended the\r\nstairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\r\nclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\r\nthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\r\ndeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\r\nobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\r\nenough for our purposes. Van Helsing\u2019s sternness was somewhat relieved\r\nby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\r\nsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:\u2014\n\u201cWhat are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\r\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl\u2019s life\r\nwon\u2019t be worth an hour\u2019s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\r\nexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\r\ncourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\r\nveins for her?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me, anyhow?\u201d\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\r\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\r\nHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\r\nglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \u201cQuincey Morris!\u201d and\r\nrushed towards him with outstretched hands.\n\u201cWhat brought you here?\u201d I cried as our hands met.\n\u201cI guess Art is the cause.\u201d\nHe handed me a telegram:\u2014\n\u201cHave not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\r\nCannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\r\nDo not delay.\u2014Holmwood.\u201d\n\u201cI think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\r\nme what to do.\u201d\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\r\nthe eyes as he said:\u2014\n\u201cA brave man\u2019s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\r\ntrouble. You\u2019re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\r\nus for all he\u2019s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\u201d\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\r\nto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\r\ntold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\r\nveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\r\noccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\r\nand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\r\nHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\r\ngood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\r\nwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\r\nto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\r\nafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\r\nbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\r\nLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\r\ntwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\r\nthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\r\nof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\r\nHe handed me the paper saying only: \u201cIt dropped from Lucy\u2019s breast when\r\nwe carried her to the bath.\u201d\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\r\nasked him: \u201cIn God\u2019s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\r\nmad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\u201d I was so bewildered that I\r\ndid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\r\npaper, saying:\u2014\n\u201cDo not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\r\nand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\r\nis it that you came to me to say?\u201d This brought me back to fact, and I\r\nwas all myself again.\n\u201cI came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\r\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\r\nto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\r\nhad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\r\nknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\r\nhad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\r\nfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\r\nregistrar and go on to the undertaker.\u201d\n\u201cGood, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\r\nsad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\r\nlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\r\nman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\r\nmore for it! Now go.\u201d\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\r\nthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\r\ngoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\r\nwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:\u2014\n\u201cWhen you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\r\nourselves?\u201d I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\r\nthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\r\nthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\r\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\r\nsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\r\nside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\r\nexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\r\nSo I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\r\nthe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\r\nrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\r\nto me:\u2014\n\u201cJack Seward, I don\u2019t want to shove myself in anywhere where I\u2019ve no\r\nright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\r\nand wanted to marry her; but, although that\u2019s all past and gone, I can\u2019t\r\nhelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that\u2019s wrong\r\nwith her? The Dutchman\u2014and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\r\nthat\u2014said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\r\nanother transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\r\nNow I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man\r\nmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\r\nno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\r\nso?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d I said, and he went on:\u2014\n\u201cI take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\r\nto-day. Is not that so?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\r\nown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\r\nsince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\r\nall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\r\nher in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\r\nwasn\u2019t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\r\nbullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\r\nbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\u201d As he spoke\r\nthe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\r\nregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\r\nmystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\r\nheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him\u2014and there was a\r\nroyal lot of it, too\u2014to keep him from breaking down. I paused before\r\nanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\r\nProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed\r\nso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\r\nin the same phrase: \u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how long has this been going on?\u201d\n\u201cAbout ten days.\u201d\n\u201cTen days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\r\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\r\nof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn\u2019t hold it.\u201d Then,\r\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \u201cWhat took it\r\nout?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis the crux. Van Helsing is simply\r\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits\u2019 end. I can\u2019t even hazard a guess.\r\nThere has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\r\nall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall\r\nnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well\u2014or ill.\u201d Quincey held\r\nout his hand. \u201cCount me in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and the Dutchman will tell me\r\nwhat to do, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy\u2019s first movement was to feel\r\nin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\r\nhad given me to read", "summary": "\nThis segment of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" focuses on Lucy Westenra's deteriorating condition and the desperate efforts to save her. When Dr. Seward and Professor Van Helsing arrive at Lucy's home, they find her deathly pale, nearly drained of blood once again. Van Helsing performs a second blood transfusion, this time using Seward's blood. The Professor displays growing alarm at Lucy's condition, particularly at the bite marks on her neck, but remains cryptic about his suspicions.\nVan Helsing introduces garlic flowers from Haarlem as a protective measure, placing them around Lucy's room and fashioning a garlic wreath for her to wear while sleeping. Though initially skeptical, Lucy reports feeling safer with the garlic protection, noting that the \"flapping against the windows\" and other nighttime disturbances cease. Unfortunately, Lucy's mother removes the protective garlic during the night, believing its strong smell harmful to her daughter, unwittingly exposing Lucy to danger.\nMeanwhile, a wolf named Bersicker escapes from the Zoological Gardens. The newspaper account includes an interview with the zookeeper, who describes a strange pale man with red eyes visiting the wolf before its escape. That same night, the wolf crashes through Lucy's window. Her mother, terrified by the sight, tears away the garlic wreath, suffers a fatal heart attack, and dies. Lucy's condition worsens dramatically as a result.\nWhen Van Helsing and Seward discover the tragedy, they find Mrs. Westenra dead and Lucy near death, with her neck wounds looking \"horribly white and mangled.\" They also find the household staff drugged with laudanum. Though they attempt another blood transfusion, Lucy continues to weaken, demonstrating that the vampire's power over her is growing stronger.\nQuincey Morris arrives unexpectedly and becomes the third blood donor for Lucy. Despite these transfusions, Lucy's body responds less effectively each time, suggesting the vampire's growing dominance. Van Helsing discovers Lucy's written account of the night's events, which confirms his suspicions about the supernatural nature of her affliction, though he continues to withhold his conclusion from the others.\nThe narrative reveals growing connections between seemingly separate events: Renfield's increasingly erratic behavior tied to his \"Master's\" presence, the escaped wolf's role in the attack on Lucy, and the mysterious loss of blood that puzzles all except Van Helsing. Quincey Morris poignantly speculates about the nature of Lucy's illness, using an analogy of a vampire bat he once encountered in the Pampas that drained his horse's blood completely, hinting at a growing understanding among the men that something unnatural is occurring.\nBy the section's end, Lucy has survived another night, but barely. The three men\u2014Seward, Van Helsing, and Quincey Morris\u2014have now all given their blood to sustain her, with Arthur Holmwood having been the first donor. Despite their sacrifices, Lucy continues to weaken, trapped in a battle against a supernatural force the men are only beginning to comprehend.\n", "map": [["Lucy Westenra", "Victim progressively dominated by vampire"], ["Professor Van Helsing", "Knowledgeable guardian concealing terrible truth"], ["Blood transfusions", "Temporary countermeasure against vampiric draining"], ["Garlic flowers", "Protective barrier against supernatural forces"], ["Mrs. Westenra", "Unwitting enabler of daughter's destruction"], ["Escaped wolf", "Animal servant of Dracula"], ["Neck wounds", "Physical evidence of vampiric attacks"], ["Blood donors", "Men sacrificing vitality for Lucy"], ["Red-eyed stranger", "Dracula's public manifestation controlling animals"], ["Written account", "Lucy's testimony confirming supernatural attack"], ["Lucy Westenra", "Neck wounds"], ["Lucy Westenra", "Garlic flowers"], ["Professor Van Helsing", "Garlic flowers"], ["Professor Van Helsing", "Blood transfusions"], ["Mrs. Westenra", "Garlic flowers"], ["Escaped wolf", "Red-eyed stranger"], ["Escaped wolf", "Lucy's window"], ["Blood donors", "Blood transfusions"], ["Lucy Westenra", "Written account"], ["Professor Van Helsing", "Written account"]]}
