I am, however, somewhat\r\ndoubtful of the truth of it. The common people in Scotland, who are fed with\r\noatmeal, are in general neither so strong nor so handsome as the same rank of\r\npeople in England, who are fed with wheaten bread. They neither work so well,\r\nnor look so well; and as there is not the same difference between the people of\r\nfashion in the two countries, experience would seem to shew, that the food of\r\nthe common people in Scotland is not so suitable to the human constitution as\r\nthat of their neighbours of the same rank in England. But it seems to be\r\notherwise with potatoes. The chairmen, porters, and coal-heavers in London, and\r\nthose unfortunate women who live by prostitution, the strongest men and the\r\nmost beautiful women perhaps in the British dominions, are said to be, the\r\ngreater part of them, from the lowest rank of people in Ireland, who are\r\ngenerally fed with this root. No food can afford a more decisive proof of its\r\nnourishing quality, or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the\r\nhuman constitution.\r\n\n\r\nIt is difficult to preserve potatoes through the year, and impossible to store\r\nthem like corn, for two or three years together. The fear of not being able to\r\nsell them before they rot, discourages their cultivation, and is, perhaps, the\r\nchief obstacle to their ever becoming in any great country, like bread, the\r\nprincipal vegetable food of all the different ranks of the people.\r\n\n\r\nHuman food seems to be the only produce of land, which always and necessarily\r\naffords some rent to the landlord. Other sorts of produce sometimes may, and\r\nsometimes may not, according to different circumstances.\r\n\n\r\nAfter food, clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind.\r\n\n\r\nLand, in its original rude state, can afford the materials of clothing and\r\nlodging to a much greater number of people than it can feed. In its improved\r\nstate, it can sometimes feed a greater number of people than it can supply with\r\nthose materials; at least in the way in which they require them, and are\r\nwilling to pay for them. In the one state, therefore, there is always a\r\nsuperabundance of these materials, which are frequently, upon that account, of\r\nlittle or no value. In the other, there is often a scarcity, which necessarily\r\naugments their value. In the one state, a great part of them is thrown away as\r\nuseless and the price of what is used is considered as equal only to the labour\r\nand expense of fitting it for use, and can, therefore, afford no rent to the\r\nlandlord. In the other, they are all made use of, and there is frequently a\r\ndemand for more than can be had. Somebody is always willing to give more for\r\nevery part of them, than what is sufficient to pay the expense of bringing them\r\nto market. Their price, therefore, can always afford some rent to the landlord.\r\n\n\r\nThe skins of the larger animals were the original materials of clothing. Among\r\nnations of hunters and shepherds, therefore, whose food consists chiefly in the\r\nflesh of those animals, everyman, by providing himself with food, provides\r\nhimself with the materials of more clothing than he can wear. If there was no\r\nforeign commerce, the greater part of them would be thrown away as things of no\r\nvalue. This was probably the case among the hunting nations of North America,\r\nbefore their country was discovered by the Europeans, with whom they now\r\nexchange their surplus peltry, for blankets, fire-arms, and brandy, which gives\r\nit some value. In the present commercial state of the known world, the most\r\nbarbarous nations, I believe, among whom land property is established, have\r\nsome foreign commerce of this kind, and find among their wealthier neighbours\r\nsuch a demand for all the materials of clothing, which their land produces, and\r\nwhich can neither be wrought up nor consumed at home, as raises their price\r\nabove what it costs to send them to those wealthier neighbours. It affords,\r\ntherefore, some rent to the landlord. When the greater part of the Highland\r\ncattle were consumed on their own hills, the exportation of their hides made\r\nthe most considerable article of the commerce of that country, and what they\r\nwere exchanged for afforded some addition to the rent of the Highland estates.\r\nThe wool of England, which in old times, could neither be consumed nor wrought\r\nup at home, found a market in the then wealthier and more industrious country\r\nof Flanders, and its price afforded something to the rent of the land which\r\nproduced it. In countries not better cultivated than England was then, or than\r\nthe Highlands of Scotland are now, and which had no foreign commerce, the\r\nmaterials of clothing would evidently be so superabundant, that a great part of\r\nthem would be thrown away as useless, and no part could afford any rent to the\r\nlandlord.\r\n\n\r\nThe materials of lodging cannot always be transported to so great a distance as\r\nthose of clothing, and do not so readily become an object of foreign commerce.\r\nWhen they are superabundant in the country which produces them, it frequently\r\nhappens, even in the present commercial state of the world, that they are of no\r\nvalue to the landlord. A good stone quarry in the neighbourhood of London would\r\nafford a considerable rent. In many parts of Scotland and Wales it affords\r\nnone. Barren timber for building is of great value in a populous and\r\nwell-cultivated country, and the land which produces it affords a considerable\r\nrent. But in many parts of North America, the landlord would be much obliged to\r\nany body who would carry away the greater part of his large trees. In some\r\nparts of the Highlands of Scotland, the bark is the only part of the wood\r\nwhich, for want of roads and water-carriage, can be sent to market; the timber\r\nis left to rot upon the ground. When the materials of lodging are so\r\nsuperabundant, the part made use of is worth only the labour and expense of\r\nfitting it for that use. It affords no rent to the landlord, who generally\r\ngrants the use of it to whoever takes the trouble of asking it. The demand of\r\nwealthier nations, however, sometimes enables him to get a rent for it. The\r\npaving of the streets of London has enabled the owners of some barren rocks on\r\nthe coast of Scotland to draw a rent from what never afforded any before. The\r\nwoods of Norway, and of the coasts of the Baltic, find a market in many parts\r\nof Great Britain, which they could not find at home, and thereby afford some\r\nrent to their proprietors.\r\n\n\r\nCountries are populous, not in proportion to the number of people whom their\r\nproduce can clothe and lodge, but in proportion to that of those whom it can\r\nfeed. When food is provided, it is easy to find the necessary clothing and\r\nlodging. But though these are at hand, it may often be difficult to find food.\r\nIn some parts of the British dominions, what is called a house may be built by\r\none day\u2019s labour of one man. The simplest species of clothing, the skins\r\nof animals, require somewhat more labour to dress and prepare them for use.\r\nThey do not, however, require a great deal. Among savage or barbarous nations,\r\na hundredth, or little more than a hundredth part of the labour of the whole\r\nyear, will be sufficient to provide them with such clothing and lodging as\r\nsatisfy the greater part of the people. All the other ninety-nine parts are\r\nfrequently no more than enough to provide them with food.\r\n\n\r\nBut when, by the improvement and cultivation of land, the labour of one family\r\ncan provide food for two, the labour of half the society becomes sufficient to\r\nprovide food for the whole. The other half, therefore, or at least the greater\r\npart of them, can be employed in providing other things, or in satisfying the\r\nother wants and fancies of mankind. Clothing and lodging, household furniture,\r\nand what is called equipage, are the principal objects of the greater part of\r\nthose wants and fancies. The rich man consumes no more food than his poor\r\nneighbour. In quality it may be very different, and to select and prepare it\r\nmay require more labour and art; but in quantity it is very nearly the same.\r\nBut compare the spacious palace and great wardrobe of the one, with the hovel\r\nand the few rags of the other, and you will be sensible that the difference\r\nbetween their clothing, lodging, and household furniture, is almost as great in\r\nquantity as it is in quality. The desire of food is limited in every man by the\r\nnarrow capacity of the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniencies and\r\nornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems to have\r\nno limit or certain boundary. Those, therefore, who have the command of more\r\nfood than they themselves can consume, are always willing to exchange the\r\nsurplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for gratifications of\r\nthis other kind. What is over and above satisfying the limited desire, is given\r\nfor the amusement of those desires which cannot be satisfied, but seem to be\r\naltogether endless. The poor, in order to obtain food, exert themselves to\r\ngratify those fancies of the rich; and to obtain it more certainly, they vie\r\nwith one another in the cheapness and perfection of their work. The number of\r\nworkmen increases with the increasing quantity of food, or with the growing\r\nimprovement and cultivation of the lands; and as the nature of their business\r\nadmits of the utmost subdivisions of labour, the quantity of materials which\r\nthey can work up, increases in a much greater proportion than their numbers.\r\nHence arises a demand for every sort of material which human invention can\r\nemploy, either usefully or ornamentally, in building, dress, equipage, or\r\nhousehold furniture; for the fossils and minerals contained in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, the precious metals, and the precious stones.\r\n\n\r\nFood is, in this manner, not only the original source of rent, but every other\r\npart of the produce of land which afterwards affords rent, derives that part of\r\nits value from the improvement of the powers of labour in producing food, by\r\nmeans of the improvement and cultivation of land.\r\n\n\r\nThose other parts of the produce of land, however, which afterwards afford\r\nrent, do not afford it always. Even in improved and cultivated countries, the\r\ndemand for them is not always such as to afford a greater price than what is\r\nsufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with its ordinary profits,\r\nthe stock which must be employed in bringing them to market. Whether it is or\r\nis not such, depends upon different circumstances.\r\n\n\r\nWhether a coal mine, for example, can afford any rent, depends partly upon its\r\nfertility, and partly upon its situation.\r\n\n\r\nA mine of any kind may be said to be either fertile or barren, according as the\r\nquantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain quantity of\r\nlabour, is greater or less than what can be brought by an equal quantity from\r\nthe greater part of other mines of the same kind.\r\n\n\r\nSome coal mines, advantageously situated, cannot be wrought on account of their\r\nbarrenness. The produce does not pay the expense. They can afford neither\r\nprofit nor rent.\r\n\n\r\nThere are some, of which the produce is barely sufficient to pay the labour,\r\nand replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock employed in working\r\nthem. They afford some profit to the undertaker of the work, but no rent to the\r\nlandlord. They can be wrought advantageously by nobody but the landlord, who,\r\nbeing himself the undertaker of the work, gets the ordinary profit of the\r\ncapital which he employs in it. Many coal mines in Scotland are wrought in this\r\nmanner, and can be wrought in no other. The landlord will allow nobody else to\r\nwork them without paying some rent, and nobody can afford to pay any.\r\n\n\r\nOther coal mines in the same country, sufficiently fertile, cannot be wrought\r\non account of their situation. A quantity of mineral, sufficient to defray the\r\nexpense of working, could be brought from the mine by the ordinary, or even\r\nless than the ordinary quantity of labour: but in an inland country, thinly\r\ninhabited, and without either good roads or water-carriage, this quantity could\r\nnot be sold.\r\n\n\r\nCoals are a less agreeable fuel than wood: they are said too to be less\r\nwholesome. The expense of coals, therefore, at the place where they are\r\nconsumed, must generally be somewhat less than that of wood.\r\n\n\r\nThe price of wood, again, varies with the state of agriculture, nearly in the\r\nsame manner, and exactly for the same reason, as the price of cattle. In its\r\nrude beginnings, the greater part of every country is covered with wood, which\r\nis then a mere incumbrance, of no value to the landlord, who would gladly give\r\nit to any body for the cutting. As agriculture advances, the woods are partly\r\ncleared by the progress of tillage, and partly go to decay in consequence of\r\nthe increased number of cattle. These, though they do not increase in the same\r\nproportion as corn, which is altogether the acquisition of human industry, yet\r\nmultiply under the care and protection of men, who store up in the season of\r\nplenty what may maintain them in that of scarcity; who, through the whole year,\r\nfurnish them with a greater quantity of food than uncultivated nature provides\r\nfor them; and who, by destroying and extirpating their enemies, secure them in\r\nthe free enjoyment of all that she provides. Numerous herds of cattle, when\r\nallowed to wander through the woods, though they do not destroy the old trees,\r\nhinder any young ones from coming up; so that, in the course of a century or\r\ntwo, the whole forest goes to ruin. The scarcity of wood then raises its price.\r\nIt affords a good rent; and the landlord sometimes finds that he can scarce\r\nemploy his best lands more advantageously than in growing barren timber, of\r\nwhich the greatness of the profit often compensates the lateness of the\r\nreturns. This seems, in the present times, to be nearly the state of things in\r\nseveral parts of Great Britain, where the profit of planting is found to be\r\nequal to that of either corn or pasture. The advantage which the landlord\r\nderives from planting can nowhere exceed, at least for any considerable time,\r\nthe rent which these could afford him; and in an inland country, which is\r\nhighly cultivated, it will frequently not fall much short of this rent. Upon\r\nthe sea-coast of a well-improved country, indeed, if coals can conveniently be\r\nhad for fuel, it may sometimes be cheaper to bring barren timber for building\r\nfrom less cultivated foreign countries than to raise it at home. In the new\r\ntown of Edinburgh, built within these few years, there is not, perhaps, a\r\nsingle stick of Scotch timber.\r\n\n\r\nWhatever may be the price of wood, if that of coals is such that the expense of\r\na coal fire is nearly equal to that of a wood one we may be assured, that at\r\nthat place, and in these circumstances, the price of coals is as high as it can\r\nbe. It seems to be so in some of the inland parts of England, particularly in\r\nOxfordshire, where it is usual, even in the fires of the common people, to mix\r\ncoals and wood together, and where the difference in the expense of those two\r\nsorts of fuel cannot, therefore, be very great. Coals, in the coal countries,\r\nare everywhere much below this highest price. If they were not, they could not\r\nbear the expense of a distant carriage, either by land or by water. A small\r\nquantity only could be sold; and the coal masters and the coal proprietors find\r\nit more for their interest to sell a great quantity at a price somewhat above\r\nthe lowest, than a small quantity at the highest. The most fertile coal mine,\r\ntoo, regulates the price of coals at all the other mines in its neighbourhood.\r\nBoth the proprietor and the undertaker of the work find, the one that he can\r\nget a greater rent, the other that he can get a greater profit, by somewhat\r\nunderselling all their neighbours. Their neighbours are soon obliged to sell at\r\nthe same price, though they cannot so well afford it, and though it always\r\ndiminishes, and sometimes takes away altogether, both their rent and their\r\nprofit. Some works are abandoned altogether; others can afford no rent, and can\r\nbe wrought only by the proprietor.\r\n\n\r\nThe lowest price at which coals can be sold for any considerable time, is, like\r\nthat of all other commodities, the price which is barely sufficient to replace,\r\ntogether with its ordinary profits, the stock which must be employed in\r\nbringing them to market. At a coal mine for which the landlord can get no rent,\r\nbut, which he must either work himself or let it alone altogether, the price of\r\ncoals must generally be nearly about this price.\r\n\n\r\nRent, even where coals afford one, has generally a smaller share in their price\r\nthan in that of most other parts of the rude produce of land. The rent of an\r\nestate above ground, commonly amounts to what is supposed to be a third of the\r\ngross produce; and it is generally a rent certain and independent of the\r\noccasional variations in the crop. In coal mines, a fifth of the gross produce\r\nis a very great rent, a tenth the common rent; and it is seldom a rent certain,\r\nbut depends upon the occasional variations in the produce. These are so great,\r\nthat in a country where thirty years purchase is considered as a moderate price\r\nfor the property of a landed estate, ten years purchase is regarded as a good\r\nprice for that of a coal mine.\r\n\n\r\nThe value of a coal mine to the proprietor, frequently depends as much upon its\r\nsituation as upon its fertility. That of a metallic mine depends more upon its\r\nfertility, and less upon its situation. The coarse, and still more the precious\r\nmetals, when separated from the ore, are so valuable, that they can generally\r\nbear the expense of a very long land, and of the most distant sea carriage.\r\nTheir market is not confined to the countries in the neighbourhood of the mine,\r\nbut extends to the whole world. The copper of Japan makes an article of\r\ncommerce in Europe; the iron of Spain in that of Chili and Peru. The silver of\r\nPeru finds its way, not only to Europe, but from Europe to China.\r\n\n\r\nThe price of coals in Westmoreland or Shropshire can have little effect on\r\ntheir price at Newcastle; and their price in the Lionnois can have none at all.\r\nThe productions of such distant coal mines can never be brought into\r\ncompetition with one another. But the productions of the most distant metallic\r\nmines frequently may, and in fact commonly are.\r\n\n\r\nThe price, therefore, of the coarse, and still more that of the precious\r\nmetals, at the most fertile mines in the world, must necessarily more or less\r\naffect their price at every other in it. The price of copper in Japan must have\r\nsome influence upon its price at the copper mines in Europe. The price of\r\nsilver in Peru, or the quantity either of labour or of other goods which it\r\nwill purchase there, must have some influence on its price, not only at the\r\nsilver mines of Europe, but at those of China. After the discovery of the mines\r\nof Peru, the silver mines of Europe were, the greater part of them, abandoned.\r\nThe value of silver was so much reduced, that their produce could no longer pay\r\nthe expense of working them, or replace, with a profit, the food, clothes,\r\nlodging, and other necessaries which were consumed in that operation. This was\r\nthe case, too, with the mines of Cuba and St. Domingo, and even with the\r\nancient mines of Peru, after the discovery of those of Potosi. The price of\r\nevery metal, at every mine, therefore, being regulated in some measure by its\r\nprice at the most fertile mine in the world that is actually wrought, it can,\r\nat the greater part of mines, do very little more than pay the expense of\r\nworking, and can seldom afford a very high rent to the landlord. Rent\r\naccordingly, seems at the greater part of mines to have but a small share in\r\nthe price of the coarse, and a still smaller in that of the precious metals.\r\nLabour and profit make up the greater part of both.\r\n\n\r\nA sixth part of the gross produce may be reckoned the average rent of the tin\r\nmines of Cornwall, the most fertile that are known in the world, as we are told\r\nby the Rev. Mr. Borlace, vice-warden of the stannaries. Some, he says, afford\r\nmore, and some do not afford so much. A sixth part of the gross produce is the\r\nrent, too, of several very fertile lead mines in Scotland.\r\n\n\r\nIn the silver mines of Peru, we are told by Frezier and Ulloa, the proprietor\r\nfrequently exacts no other acknowledgment from the undertaker of the mine, but\r\nthat he will grind the ore at his mill, paying him the ordinary multure or\r\nprice of grinding. Till 1736, indeed, the tax of the king of Spain amounted to\r\none fifth of the standard silver, which till then might be considered as the\r\nreal rent of the greater part of the silver mines of Peru, the richest which\r\nhave been known in the world. If there had been no tax, this fifth would\r\nnaturally have belonged to the landlord, and many mines might have been wrought\r\nwhich could not then be wrought, because they could not afford this tax. The\r\ntax of the duke of Cornwall upon tin is supposed to amount to more than five\r\nper cent. or one twentieth part of the value; and whatever may be his\r\nproportion, it would naturally, too, belong to the proprietor of the mine, if\r\ntin was duty free. But if you add one twentieth to one sixth, you will find\r\nthat the whole average rent of the tin mines of Cornwall, was to the whole\r\naverage rent of the silver mines of Peru, as thirteen to twelve. But the silver\r\nmines of Peru are not now able to pay even this low rent; and the tax upon\r\nsilver was, in 1736, reduced from one fifth to one tenth. Even this tax upon\r\nsilver, too, gives more temptation to smuggling than the tax of one twentieth\r\nupon tin; and smuggling must be much easier in the precious than in the bulky\r\ncommodity. The tax of the king of Spain, accordingly, is said to be very ill\r\npaid, and that of the duke of Cornwall very well. Rent, therefore, it is\r\nprobable, makes a greater part of the price of tin at the most fertile tin\r\nmines than it does of silver at the most fertile silver mines in the world.\r\nAfter replacing the stock employed in working those different mines, together\r\nwith its ordinary profits, the residue which remains to the proprietor is\r\ngreater, it seems, in the coarse, than in the precious metal.\r\n\n\r\nNeither are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly very great\r\nin Peru. The same most respectable and well-informed authors acquaint us, that\r\nwhen any person undertakes to work a new mine in Peru, he is universally looked\r\nupon as a man destined to bankruptcy and ruin, and is upon that account shunned\r\nand avoided by every body. Mining, it seems, is considered there in the same\r\nlight as here, as a lottery, in which the prizes do not compensate the blanks,\r\nthough the greatness of some tempts many adventurers to throw away their\r\nfortunes in such unprosperous projects.\r\n\n\r\nAs the sovereign, however, derives a considerable part of his revenue from the\r\nproduce of silver mines, the law in Peru gives every possible encouragement to\r\nthe discovery and working of new ones. Whoever discovers a new mine, is\r\nentitled to measure off two hundred and forty-six feet in length, according to\r\nwhat he supposes to be the direction of the vein, and half as much in breadth.\r\nHe becomes proprietor of this portion of the mine, and can work it without\r\npaving any acknowledgment to the landlord. The interest of the duke of Cornwall\r\nhas given occasion to a regulation nearly of the same kind in that ancient\r\ndutchy. In waste and uninclosed lands, any person who discovers a tin mine may\r\nmark out its limits to a certain extent, which is called bounding a mine. The\r\nbounder becomes the real proprietor of the mine, and may either work it\r\nhimself, or give it in lease to another, without the consent of the owner of\r\nthe land, to whom, however, a very small acknowledgment must be paid upon\r\nworking it. In both regulations, the sacred rights of private property are\r\nsacrificed to the supposed interests of public revenue.\r\n\n\r\nThe same encouragement is given in Peru to the discovery and working of new\r\ngold mines; and in gold the king\u2019s tax amounts only to a twentieth part\r\nof the standard rental. It was once a fifth, and afterwards a tenth, as in\r\nsilver; but it was found that the work could not bear even the lowest of these\r\ntwo taxes. If it is rare, however, say the same authors, Frezier and Ulloa, to\r\nfind a person who has made his fortune by a silver, it is still much rarer to\r\nfind one who has done so by a gold mine. This twentieth part seems to be the\r\nwhole rent which is paid by the greater part of the gold mines of Chili and\r\nPeru. Gold, too, is much more liable to be smuggled than even silver; not only\r\non account of the superior value of the metal in proportion to its bulk, but on\r\naccount of the peculiar way in which nature produces it. Silver is very seldom\r\nfound virgin, but, like most other metals, is generally mineralized with some\r\nother body, from which it is impossible to separate it in such quantities as\r\nwill pay for the expense, but by a very laborious and tedious operation, which\r\ncannot well be carried on but in work-houses erected for the purpose, and,\r\ntherefore, exposed to the inspection of the king\u2019s officers. Gold, on the\r\ncontrary, is almost always found virgin. It is sometimes found in pieces of\r\nsome bulk; and, even when mixed, in small and almost insensible particles, with\r\nsand, earth, and other extraneous bodies, it can be separated from them by a\r\nvery short and simple operation, which can be carried on in any private house\r\nby any body who is possessed of a small quantity of mercury. If the\r\nking\u2019s tax, therefore, is but ill paid upon silver, it is likely to be\r\nmuch worse paid upon gold; and rent must make a much smaller part of the price\r\nof gold than that of silver.\r\n\n\r\nThe lowest price at which the precious metals can be sold, or the smallest\r\nquantity of other goods for which they can be exchanged, during any\r\nconsiderable time, is regulated by the same principles which fix the lowest\r\nordinary price of all other goods. The stock which must commonly be employed,\r\nthe food, clothes, and lodging, which must commonly be consumed in bringing\r\nthem from the mine to the market, determine it. It must at least be sufficient\r\nto replace that stock, with the ordinary profits.\r\n\n\r\nTheir highest price, however, seems not to be necessarily determined by any\r\nthing but the actual scarcity or plenty of these metals themselves. It is not\r\ndetermined by that of any other commodity, in the same manner as the price of\r\ncoals is by that of wood, beyond which no scarcity can ever raise it. Increase\r\nthe scarcity of gold to a certain degree, and the smallest bit of it may become\r\nmore precious than a diamond, and exchange for a greater quantity of other\r\ngoods.\r\n\n\r\nThe demand for those metals arises partly from their utility, and partly from\r\ntheir beauty. If you except iron, they are more useful than, perhaps, any other\r\nmetal. As they are less liable to rust and impurity, they can more easily be\r\nkept clean; and the utensils, either of the table or the kitchen, are often,\r\nupon that account, more agreeable when made of them. A silver boiler is more\r\ncleanly than a lead, copper, or tin one; and the same quality would render a\r\ngold boiler still better than a silver one. Their principal merit, however,\r\narises from their beauty, which renders them peculiarly fit for the ornaments\r\nof dress and furniture. No paint or dye can give so splendid a colour as\r\ngilding. The merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their scarcity. With\r\nthe greater part of rich people, the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the\r\nparade of riches; which, in their eye, is never so complete as when they appear\r\nto possess those decisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but\r\nthemselves. In their eyes, the merit of an object, which is in any degree\r\neither useful or beautiful, is greatly enhanced by its scarcity, or by the\r\ngreat labour which it requires to collect any considerable quantity of it; a\r\nlabour which nobody can afford to pay but themselves. Such objects they are\r\nwilling to purchase at a higher price than things much more beautiful and\r\nuseful, but more common. These qualities of utility, beauty, and scarcity, are\r\nthe original foundation of the high price of those metals, or of the great\r\nquantity of other goods for which they can everywhere be exchanged. This value\r\nwas antecedent to, and independent of their being employed as coin, and was the\r\nquality which fitted them for that employment. That employment, however, by\r\noccasioning a new demand, and by diminishing the quantity which could be\r\nemployed in any other way, may have afterwards contributed to keep up or\r\nincrease their value.\r\n\n\r\nThe demand for the precious stones arises altogether from their beauty. They\r\nare of no use but as ornaments; and the merit of their beauty is greatly\r\nenhanced by their scarcity, or by the difficulty and expense of getting them\r\nfrom the mine. Wages and profit accordingly make up, upon most occasions,\r\nalmost the whole of the high price. Rent comes in but for a very small share,\r\nfrequently for no share; and the most fertile mines only afford any\r\nconsiderable rent. When Tavernier, a jeweller, visited the diamond mines of\r\nGolconda and Visiapour, he was informed that the sovereign of the country, for\r\nwhose benefit they were wrought, had ordered all of them to be shut up except\r\nthose which yielded the largest and finest stones. The other, it seems, were to\r\nthe proprietor not worth the working.\r\n\n\r\nAs the prices, both of the precious metals and of the precious stones, is\r\nregulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine in it, the\r\nrent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in proportion, not\r\nto its absolute, but to what may be called its relative fertility, or to its\r\nsuperiority over other mines of the same kind. If new mines were discovered, as\r\nmuch superior to those of Potosi, as they were superior to those of Europe, the\r\nvalue of silver might be so much degraded as to render even the mines of Potosi\r\nnot worth the working. Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, the\r\nmost fertile mines in Europe may have afforded as great a rent to their\r\nproprietors as the richest mines in Peru do at present. Though the quantity of\r\nsilver was much less, it might have exchanged for an equal quantity of other\r\ngoods, and the proprietor\u2019s share might have enabled him to purchase or\r\ncommand an equal quantity either of labour or of commodities.\r\n\n\r\nThe value, both of the produce and of the rent, the real revenue which they\r\nafforded, both to the public and to the proprietor, might have been the same.\r\n\n\r\nThe most abundant mines, either of the precious metals, or of the precious\r\nstones, could add little to the wealth of the world. A produce, of which the\r\nvalue is principally derived from its scarcity, is necessarily degraded by its\r\nabundance. A service of plate, and the other frivolous ornaments of dress and\r\nfurniture, could be purchased for a smaller quantity of commodities; and in\r\nthis would consist the sole advantage which the world could derive from that\r\nabundance.\r\n\n\r\nIt is otherwise in estates above ground. The value, both of their produce and\r\nof their rent, is in proportion to their absolute, and not to their relative\r\nfertility. The land which produces a certain quantity of food, clothes, and\r\nlodging, can always feed, clothe, and lodge, a certain number of people; and\r\nwhatever may be the proportion of the landlord, it will always give him a\r\nproportionable command of the labour of those people, and of the commodities\r\nwith which that labour can supply him. The value of the most barren land is not\r\ndiminished by the neighbourhood of the most fertile. On the contrary, it is\r\ngenerally increased by it. The great number of people maintained by the fertile\r\nlands afford a market to many parts of the produce of the barren, which they\r\ncould never have found among those whom their own produce could maintain.\r\n\n\r\nWhatever increases the fertility of land in producing food, increases not only\r\nthe value of the lands upon which the improvement is bestowed, but contributes\r\nlikewise to increase that of many other lands, by creating a new demand for\r\ntheir produce. That abundance of food, of which, in consequence of the\r\nimprovement of land, many people have the disposal beyond what they themselves\r\ncan consume, is the great cause of the demand, both for the precious metals and\r\nthe precious stones, as well as for every other conveniency and ornament of\r\ndress, lodging, household furniture, and equipage. Food not only constitutes\r\nthe principal part of the riches of the world, but it is the abundance of food\r\nwhich gives the principal part of their value to many other sorts of riches.\r\nThe poor inhabitants of Cuba and St. Domingo, when they were first discovered\r\nby the Spaniards, used to wear little bits of gold as ornaments in their hair\r\nand other parts of their dress. They seemed to value them as we would do any\r\nlittle pebbles of somewhat more than ordinary beauty, and to consider them as\r\njust worth the picking up, but not worth the refusing to any body who asked\r\nthem, They gave them to their new guests at the first request, without seeming\r\nto think that they had made them any very valuable present. They were\r\nastonished to observe the rage of the Spaniards to obtain them; and had no\r\nnotion that there could anywhere be a country in which many people had the\r\ndisposal of so great a superfluity of food; so scanty always among themselves,\r\nthat, for a very small quantity of those glittering baubles, they would\r\nwillingly give as much as might maintain a whole family for many years. Could\r\nthey have been made to understand this, the passion of the Spaniards would not\r\nhave surprised them.\r\n\n\r\nThe increasing abundance of food, in consequence of the increasing improvement\r\nand cultivation, must necessarily increase the demand for every part of the\r\nproduce of land which is not food, and which can be applied either to use or to\r\nornament. In the whole progress of improvement, it might, therefore, be\r\nexpected there should be only one variation in the comparative values of those\r\ntwo different sorts of produce. The value of that sort which sometimes does,\r\nand sometimes does not afford rent, should constantly rise in proportion to\r\nthat which always affords some rent. As art and industry advance, the materials\r\nof clothing and lodging, the useful fossils and materials of the earth, the\r\nprecious metals and the precious stones, should gradually come to be more and\r\nmore in demand, should gradually exchange for a greater and a greater quantity\r\nof food; or, in other words, should gradually become dearer and dearer. This,\r\naccordingly, has been the case with most of these things upon most occasions,\r\nand would have been the case with all of them upon all occasions, if particular\r\naccidents had not, upon some occasions, increased the supply of some of them in\r\na still greater proportion than the demand.\r\n\n\r\nThe value of a free-stone quarry, for example, will necessarily increase with\r\nthe increasing improvement and population of the country round about it,\r\nespecially if it should be the only one in the neighbourhood. But the value of\r\na silver mine, even though there should not be another within a thousand miles\r\nof it, will not necessarily increase with the improvement of the country in\r\nwhich it is situated. The market for the produce of a free-stone quarry can\r\nseldom extend more than a few miles round about it, and the demand must\r\ngenerally be in proportion to the improvement and population of that small\r\ndistrict; but the market for the produce of a silver mine may extend over the\r\nwhole known world. Unless the world in general, therefore, be advancing in\r\nimprovement and population, the demand for silver might not be at all increased\r\nby the improvement even of a large country in the neighbourhood of the mine.\r\nEven though the world in general were improving, yet if, in the course of its\r\nimprovements, new mines should be discovered, much more fertile than any which\r\nhad been known before, though the demand for silver would necessarily increase,\r\nyet the supply might increase in so much a greater proportion, that the real\r\nprice of that metal might gradually fall; that is, any given quantity, a pound\r\nweight of it, for example, might gradually purchase or command a smaller and a\r\nsmaller quantity of labour, or exchange for a smaller and a smaller quantity of\r\ncorn, the principal part of the subsistence of the labourer.\r\n\n\r\nThe great market for silver is the commercial and civilized part of the world.\r\n\n\r\nIf, by the general progress of improvement, the demand of this market should\r\nincrease, while, at the same time, the supply did not increase in the same\r\nproportion, the value of silver would gradually rise in proportion to that of\r\ncorn. Any given quantity of silver would exchange for a greater and a greater\r\nquantity of corn; or, in other words, the average money price of corn would\r\ngradually become cheaper and cheaper.\r\n\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the supply, by some accident, should increase, for many\r\nyears together, in a greater proportion than the demand, that metal would\r\ngradually become cheaper and cheaper; or, in other words, the average money\r\nprice of corn would, in spite of all improvements, gradually become dearer and\r\ndearer.\r\n\n\r\nBut if, on the other hand, the supply of that metal should increase nearly in\r\nthe same proportion as the demand, it would continue to purchase or exchange\r\nfor nearly the same quantity of corn; and the average money price of corn\r\nwould, in spite of all improvements. continue very nearly the same.\r\n\n\r\nThese three seem to exhaust all the possible combinations of events which can\r\nhappen in the progress of improvement; and during the course of the four\r\ncenturies preceding the present, if we may judge by what has happened both in\r\nFrance and Great Britain, each of those three different combinations seems to\r\nhave taken place in the European market, and nearly in the same order, too, in\r\nwhich I have here set them down.\r\n\n\nDigression concerning the Variations in the value of Silver during the\r\nCourse of the Four last Centuries.\n\n\r\nFirst Period.\u2014In 1350, and for some time before, the average price of the\r\nquarter of wheat in England seems not to have been estimated lower than four\r\nounces of silver, Tower weight, equal to about twenty shillings of our present\r\nmoney. From this price it seems to have fallen gradually to two ounces of\r\nsilver, equal to about ten shillings of our present money, the price at which\r\nwe find it estimated in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and at which it\r\nseems to have continued to be estimated till about 1570.\r\n\n\r\nIn 1350, being the 25th of Edward III. was enacted what is called the Statute\r\nof Labourers. In the preamble, it complains much of the insolence of servants,\r\nwho endeavoured to raise their wages upon their masters. It therefore ordains,\r\nthat all servants and labourers should, for the future, be contented with the\r\nsame wages and liveries (liveries in those times signified not only clothes,\r\nbut provisions) which they had been accustomed to receive in the 20th year of\r\nthe king, and the four preceding years; that, upon this account, their\r\nlivery-wheat should nowhere be estimated higher than tenpence a-bushel, and\r\nthat it should always be in the option of the master to deliver them either the\r\nwheat or the money. Tenpence: a-bushel, therefore, had, in the 25th of Edward\r\nIII. been reckoned a very moderate price of wheat, since it required a\r\nparticular statute to oblige servants to accept of it in exchange for their\r\nusual livery of provisions; and it had been reckoned a reasonable price ten\r\nyears before that, or in the 16th year of the king, the term to which the\r\nstatute refers. But in the 16th year of Edward III. tenpence contained about\r\nhalf an ounce of silver, Tower weight, and was nearly equal to half-a-crown of\r\nour present money. Four ounces of silver, Tower weight, therefore, equal to six\r\nshillings and eightpence of the money of those times, and to near twenty\r\nshillings of that of the present, must have been reckoned a moderate price for\r\nthe quarter of eight bushels.\r\n\n\r\nThis statute is surely a better evidence of what was reckoned, in those times,\r\na moderate price of grain, than the prices of some particular years, which have\r\ngenerally been recorded by historians and other writers, on account of their\r\nextraordinary dearness or cheapness, and from which, therefore, it is difficult\r\nto form any judgment concerning what may have been the ordinary price. There\r\nare, besides, other reasons for believing that, in the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, and for some time before, the common price of wheat was not\r\nless than four ounces of silver the quarter, and that of other grain in\r\nproportion.\r\n\n\r\nIn 1309, Ralph de Born, prior of St Augustine\u2019s, Canterbury, gave a feast\r\nupon his installation-day, of which William Thorn has preserved, not only the\r\nbill of fare, but the prices of many particulars. In that feast were consumed,\r\n1st, fifty-three quarters of wheat, which cost nineteen pounds, or seven\r\nshillings, and twopence a-quarter, equal to about one-and-twenty shillings and\r\nsixpence of our present money; 2dly, fifty-eight quarters of malt, which cost\r\nseventeen pounds ten shillings, or six shillings a-quarter, equal to about\r\neighteen shillings of our present money; 3dly, twenty quarters of oats, which\r\ncost four pounds, or four shillings a-quarter, equal to about twelve shillings\r\nof our present money. The prices of malt and oats seem here to be higher than\r\ntheir ordinary proportion to the price of wheat.\r\n\n\r\nThese prices are not recorded, on account of their extraordinary dearness or\r\ncheapness, but are mentioned accidentally, as the prices actually paid for\r\nlarge quantities of grain consumed at a feast, which was famous for its\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\n\r\nIn 1262, being the 51st of Henry III. was revived an ancient statute, called\r\nthe assize of bread and ale, which, the king says in the preamble, had been\r\nmade in the times of his progenitors, some time kings of England. It is\r\nprobably, therefore, as old at least as the time of his grandfather, Henry II.\r\nand may have been as old as the Conquest. It regulates the price of bread\r\naccording as the prices of wheat may happen to be, from one shilling to twenty\r\nshillings the quarter of the money of those times. But statutes of this kind\r\nare generally presumed to provide with equal care for all deviations from the\r\nmiddle price, for those below it, as well as for those above it. Ten shillings,\r\ntherefore, containing six ounces of silver, Tower weight, and equal to about\r\nthirty shillings of our present money, must, upon this supposition, have been\r\nreckoned the middle price of the quarter of wheat when this statute was first\r\nenacted, and must have continued to be so in the 51st of Henry III. We cannot,\r\ntherefore, be very wrong in supposing that the middle price was not less than\r\none-third of the highest price at which this statute regulates the price of\r\nbread, or than six shillings and eightpence of the money of those times,\r\ncontaining four ounces of silver, Tower weight.\r\n\n\r\nFrom these different facts, therefore, we seem to have some reason to conclude\r\nthat, about the middle of the fourteenth century, and for a considerable time\r\nbefore, the average or ordinary price of the quarter of wheat was not supposed\r\nto be less than four ounces of silver, Tower weight.\r\n\n\r\nFrom about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, what was reckoned the reasonable and moderate, that is, the ordinary\r\nor average price of wheat, seems to have sunk gradually to about one half of\r\nthis price; so as at last to have fallen to about two ounces of silver, Tower\r\nweight, equal to about ten shillings of our present money. It continued to be\r\nestimated at this price till about 1570.\r\n\n\r\nIn the household book of Henry, the fifth earl of Northumberland, drawn up in\r\n1512 there are two different estimations of wheat. In one of them it is\r\ncomputed at six shilling and eightpence the quarter, in the other at five\r\nshillings and eightpence only. In 1512, six shillings and eightpence contained\r\nonly two ounces of silver, Tower weight, and were equal to about ten shillings\r\nof our present money.\r\n\n\r\nFrom the 25th of Edward III. to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, during\r\nthe space of more than two hundred years, six shillings and eightpence, it\r\nappears from several different statutes, had continued to be considered as what\r\nis called the moderate and reasonable, that is, the ordinary or average price\r\nof wheat. The quantity of silver, however, contained in that nominal sum was,\r\nduring the course of this period, continually diminishing in consequence of\r\nsome alterations which were made in the coin. But the increase of the value of\r\nsilver had, it seems, so far compensated the diminution of the quantity of it\r\ncontained in the same nominal sum, that the legislature did not think it worth\r\nwhile to attend to this circumstance.\r\n\n\r\nThus, in 1436, it was enacted, that wheat might be exported without a licence\r\nwhen the price was so low as six shillings and eightpence: and in 1463, it was\r\nenacted, that no wheat should be imported if the price was not above six\r\nshillings and eightpence the quarter: The legislature had imagined, that when\r\nthe price was so low, there could be no inconveniency in exportation, but that\r\nwhen it rose higher, it became prudent to allow of importation. Six shillings\r\nand eightpence, therefore, containing about the same quantity of silver as\r\nthirteen shillings and fourpence of our present money (one-third part less than\r\nthe same nominal sum contained in the time of Edward III), had, in those times,\r\nbeen considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat.\r\n\n\r\nIn 1554, by the 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary, and in 1558, by the 1st of\r\nElizabeth, the exportation of wheat was in the same manner prohibited, whenever\r\nthe price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and eightpence, which did\r\nnot then contain two penny worth more silver than the same nominal sum does at\r\npresent. But it had soon been found, that to restrain the exportation of wheat\r\ntill the price was so very low, was, in reality, to prohibit it altogether. In\r\n1562, therefore, by the 5th of Elizabeth, the exportation of wheat was allowed\r\nfrom certain ports, whenever the price of the quarter should not exceed ten\r\nshillings, containing nearly the same quantity of silver as the like nominal\r\nsum does at present. This price had at this time, therefore, been considered as\r\nwhat is called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat. It agrees nearly\r\nwith the estimation of the Northumberland book in 1512.\r\n\n\r\nThat in France the average price of grain was, in the same manner, much lower\r\nin the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century, than in the\r\ntwo centuries preceding, has been observed both by Mr Dupr\u00e9 de St Maur, and by\r\nthe elegant author of the Essay on the Policy of Grain. Its price, during the\r\nsame period, had probably sunk in the same manner through the greater part of\r\nEurope.\r\n\n\r\nThis rise in the value of silver, in proportion to that of corn, may either\r\nhave been owing altogether to the increase of the demand for that metal, in\r\nconsequence of increasing improvement and cultivation, the supply, in the mean\r\ntime, continuing the same as before; or, the demand continuing the same as\r\nbefore, it may have been owing altogether to the gradual diminution of the\r\nsupply: the greater part of the mines which were then known in the world being\r\nmuch exhausted, and, consequently, the expense of working them much increased;\r\nor it may have been owing partly to the one, and partly to the other of those\r\ntwo circumstances. In the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncenturies, the greater part of Europe was approaching towards a more settled\r\nform of government than it had enjoyed for several ages before. The increase of\r\nsecurity would naturally increase industry and improvement; and the demand for\r\nthe precious metals, as well as for every other luxury and ornament, would\r\nnaturally increase with the increase of riches. A greater annual produce would\r\nrequire a greater quantity of coin to circulate it; and a greater number of\r\nrich people would require a greater quantity of plate and other ornaments of\r\nsilver. It is natural to suppose, too, that the greater part of the mines which\r\nthen supplied the European market with silver might be a good deal exhausted,\r\nand have become more expensive in the working. They had been wrought, many of\r\nthem, from the time of the Romans.\r\n\n\r\nIt has been the opinion, however, of the greater part of those who have written\r\nupon the prices of commodities in ancient times, that, from the Conquest,\r\nperhaps from the invasion of Julius Caesar, till the discovery of the mines of\r\nAmerica, the value of silver was continually diminishing. This opinion they\r\nseem to have been led into, partly by the observations which they had occasion\r\nto make upon the prices both of corn and of some other parts of the rude\r\nproduce of land, and partly by the popular notion, that as the quantity of\r\nsilver naturally increases in every country with the increase of wealth, so its\r\nvalue diminishes as it quantity increases.\r\n\n\r\nIn their observations upon the prices of corn, three different circumstances\r\nseem frequently to have misled them.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, in ancient times, almost all rents were paid in kind; in a certain\r\nquantity of corn, cattle, poultry, etc. It sometimes happened, however, that\r\nthe landlord would stipulate, that he should be at liberty to demand of the\r\ntenant, either the annual payment in kind or a certain sum of money instead of\r\nit. The price at which the payment in kind was in this manner exchanged for a\r\ncertain sum of money, is in Scotland called the conversion price. As the option\r\nis always in the landlord to take either the substance or the price, it is\r\nnecessary, for the safety of the tenant, that the conversion price should\r\nrather be below than above the average market price. In many places,\r\naccordingly, it is not much above one half of this price. Through the greater\r\npart of Scotland this custom still continues with regard to poultry, and in\r\nsome places with regard to cattle. It might probably have continued to take\r\nplace, too, with regard to corn, had not the institution of the public fiars\r\nput an end to it. These are annual valuations, according to the judgment of an\r\nassize, of the average price of all the different sorts of grain, and of all\r\nthe different qualities of each, according to the actual market price in every\r\ndifferent county. This institution rendered it sufficiently safe for the\r\ntenant, and much more convenient for the landlord, to convert, as they call it,\r\nthe corn rent, rather at what should happen to be the price of the fiars of\r\neach year, than at any certain fixed price. But the writers who have collected\r\nthe prices of corn in ancient times seem frequently to have mistaken what is\r\ncalled in Scotland the conversion price for the actual market price. Fleetwood\r\nacknowledges, upon one occasion, that he had made this mistake. As he wrote his\r\nbook, however, for a particular purpose, he does not think proper to make this\r\nacknowledgment till after transcribing this conversion price fifteen times. The\r\nprice is eight shillings the quarter of wheat. This sum in 1423, the year at\r\nwhich he begins with it, contained the same quantity of silver as sixteen\r\nshillings of our present money. But in 1562, the year at which he ends with it,\r\nit contained no more than the same nominal sum does at present.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, they have been misled by the slovenly manner in which some ancient\r\nstatutes of assize had been sometimes transcribed by lazy copiers, and\r\nsometimes, perhaps, actually composed by the legislature.\r\n\n\r\nThe ancient statutes of assize seem to have begun always with determining what\r\nought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat and barley were\r\nat the lowest; and to have proceeded gradually to determine what it ought to\r\nbe, according as the prices of those two sorts of grain should gradually rise\r\nabove this lowest price. But the transcribers of those statutes seem frequently\r\nto have thought it sufficient to copy the regulation as far as the three or\r\nfour first and lowest prices; saving in this manner their own labour, and\r\njudging, I suppose, that this was enough to show what proportion ought to be\r\nobserved in all higher prices.\r\n\n\r\nThus, in the assize of bread and ale, of the 51st of Henry III. the price of\r\nbread was regulated according to the different prices of wheat, from one\r\nshilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times. But in\r\nthe manuscripts from which all the different editions of the statutes,\r\npreceding that of Mr Ruffhead, were printed, the copiers had never transcribed\r\nthis regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings. Several writers,\r\ntherefore, being misled by this faulty transcription, very naturally conclude\r\nthat the middle price, or six shillings the quarter, equal to about eighteen\r\nshillings of our present money, was the ordinary or average price of wheat at\r\nthat time", "summary": "\nIn this section, Smith discusses the nutritional value of different food types, noting that while oatmeal is considered hearty in Scotland and Lancashire, the physical condition of Scots compared to English wheat-eaters suggests otherwise. Potatoes, however, prove exceptionally nutritious, as evidenced by the robust health of Irish laborers in London who subsist on them. Their perishability, though, prevents potatoes from becoming a universal staple food.\nSmith explains that after food, clothing and lodging are humanity's primary needs. In undeveloped societies, materials for clothing and shelter are abundant and often valueless, but as civilization advances, they become scarce and valuable. He illustrates this with examples of animal hides that hunting societies might discard but that become valuable trade goods when there's foreign demand. Similarly, timber and stone have little value in remote regions but become precious near cities where demand is high.\nPopulation density, Smith observes, depends more on food availability than materials for clothing and shelter. As agricultural productivity increases, societies can dedicate more labor to non-food production, leading to increased demand for luxury goods and construction materials. This creates the economic foundation for trade, as those with food surpluses exchange them for manufactured items and ornaments.\nThe text explores how mines produce rent for landowners, noting that profitability depends on both fertility (mineral yield per unit of labor) and location (proximity to markets). Smith explains that coal mines, being bulky to transport, depend more on location than metal mines, whose high value-to-weight ratio makes them profitable to ship globally. Mining operations typically yield less rent to landowners than agricultural land, with many mines barely covering operational costs.\nPrecious metals and stones derive their value from utility, beauty, and scarcity. Their value is regulated by the most productive mines worldwide, with less productive mines generating little or no rent. The discovery of new, more fertile mines can lower metal values, as happened when Spanish explorers found silver in the Americas.\nUnlike mines, agricultural improvements always increase land value by enabling more food production, which increases demand for metals and luxury goods. Smith illustrates this with an anecdote about indigenous peoples who placed little value on gold until they understood the Spaniards' desire for it stemmed from their abundant food supplies.\nSmith concludes by discussing historical changes in silver prices relative to grain from the 14th to 16th centuries, noting that silver became more valuable during this period. He attributes this to increased demand from economic growth, decreased supply from exhausted mines, or both. He also critiques earlier economic writers who believed silver was continuously decreasing in value, pointing out methodological errors in their research on historical commodity prices.\n", "map": [["Nutritional value", "Population health"], ["Potato consumption", "Physical robustness"], ["Food perishability", "Staple food limitations"], ["Population density", "Food availability"], ["Agricultural productivity", "Non-food labor allocation"], ["Food surplus", "Luxury goods demand"], ["Raw materials", "Civilization-driven scarcity"], ["Resource proximity", "Value determination"], ["Mine fertility", "Mineral yield per labor"], ["Mine location", "Transport cost impact"], ["Coal mines", "Location dependency"], ["Metal mines", "Global transportability"], ["Mining operations", "Minimal landlord rent"], ["Precious metals", "Utility-beauty-scarcity value"], ["Mine productivity", "Metal price regulation"], ["Agricultural improvements", "Consistent land value increase"], ["Food abundance", "Luxury goods valuation"], ["Silver-grain price ratio", "Historical economic shifts"], ["Economic growth", "Precious metal demand"], ["Mine exhaustion", "Metal supply decrease"]]}
