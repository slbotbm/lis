I arrived\r\nhere yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and\r\nincreasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.\r\n\n\r\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh,\r\nI feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and\r\nfills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has\r\ntravelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste\r\nof those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become\r\nmore fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat\r\nof frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\r\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its\r\nbroad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.\r\nThere\u2014for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding\r\nnavigators\u2014there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we\r\nmay be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region\r\nhitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be\r\nwithout example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in\r\nthose undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal\r\nlight? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and\r\nmay regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to\r\nrender their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my\r\nardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited,\r\nand may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my\r\nenticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and\r\nto induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when\r\nhe embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of\r\ndiscovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false,\r\nyou cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind,\r\nto the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those\r\ncountries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by\r\nascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be\r\neffected by an undertaking such as mine.\r\n\n\r\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter,\r\nand I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for\r\nnothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose\u2014a\r\npoint on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been\r\nthe favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of\r\nthe various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the\r\nNorth Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember\r\nthat a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\r\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas\u2019 library. My education was neglected, yet I was\r\npassionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my\r\nfamiliarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on\r\nlearning that my father\u2019s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me\r\nto embark in a seafaring life.\r\n\n\r\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose\r\neffusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and\r\nfor one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also\r\nmight obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are\r\nconsecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the\r\ndisappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and\r\nmy thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\r\n\n\r\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even\r\nnow, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.\r\nI commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on\r\nseveral expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine,\r\nthirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during\r\nthe day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of\r\nmedicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer\r\nmight derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as\r\nan under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must\r\nown I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the\r\nvessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable\r\ndid he consider my services.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My\r\nlife might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every\r\nenticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would\r\nanswer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes\r\nfluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long\r\nand difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I\r\nam required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain\r\nmy own, when theirs are failing.\r\n\n\r\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly\r\nover the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far\r\nmore agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive,\r\nif you are wrapped in furs\u2014a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a\r\ngreat difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for\r\nhours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your\r\nveins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St.\r\nPetersburgh and Archangel.\r\n\n\r\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\r\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\r\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\r\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail\r\nuntil the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I\r\nanswer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass\r\nbefore you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.\r\n\n\r\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and\r\nsave me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and\r\nkindness.\r\n\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\nR. Walton\r\n\n\nTo Mrs. Saville, England.\n\n\r\nArchangel, 28th March, 17\u2014.\r\n\n\r\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet a\r\nsecond step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am\r\noccupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to\r\nbe men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.\r\n\n\r\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\r\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\r\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will\r\nbe none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will\r\nendeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it\r\nis true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire\r\nthe company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to\r\nmine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of\r\na friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a\r\ncultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to\r\napprove or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your\r\npoor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.\r\nBut it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first\r\nfourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle\r\nThomas\u2019 books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated\r\npoets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power\r\nto derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived\r\nthe necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\r\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\r\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\r\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\r\ncall it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\r\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour\r\nto regulate my mind.\r\n\n\r\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\r\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some\r\nfeelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged\r\nbosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and\r\nenterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more\r\ncharacteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and\r\nin the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by\r\ncultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became\r\nacquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in\r\nthis city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.\r\n\n\r\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\r\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance,\r\nadded to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous\r\nto engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your\r\ngentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character\r\nthat I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on\r\nboard ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a\r\nmariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience\r\npaid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to\r\nsecure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a\r\nlady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story.\r\nSome years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having\r\namassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to\r\nthe match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was\r\nbathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\r\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and\r\nthat her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured\r\nthe suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly\r\nabandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he\r\nhad designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on\r\nhis rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and\r\nthen himself solicited the young woman\u2019s father to consent to her marriage with\r\nher lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour\r\nto my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country,\r\nnor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to\r\nher inclinations. \u201cWhat a noble fellow!\u201d you will exclaim. He is so; but then\r\nhe is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant\r\ncarelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more\r\nastonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would\r\ncommand.\r\n\n\r\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a\r\nconsolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my\r\nresolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed\r\nuntil the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully\r\nsevere, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably\r\nearly season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do\r\nnothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and\r\nconsiderateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.\r\n\n\r\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.\r\nIt is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation,\r\nhalf pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am\r\ngoing to unexplored regions, to \u201cthe land of mist and snow,\u201d but I shall kill\r\nno albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come\r\nback to you as worn and woeful as the \u201cAncient Mariner.\u201d You will smile at my\r\nallusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment\r\nto, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\r\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work\r\nin my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious\u2014painstaking,\r\na workman to execute with perseverance and labour\u2014but besides this there is a\r\nlove for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my\r\nprojects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild\r\nsea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.\r\n\n\r\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having\r\ntraversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or\r\nAmerica? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the\r\nreverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every\r\nopportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most\r\nto support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection,\r\nshould you never hear from me again.\r\n\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\nRobert Walton\r\n\n\nTo Mrs. Saville, England.\n\n\r\nJuly 7th, 17\u2014.\r\n\n\r\nMy dear Sister,\r\n\n\r\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe\u2014and well advanced on my\r\nvoyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward\r\nvoyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,\r\nperhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and\r\napparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually\r\npass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing,\r\nappear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is\r\nthe height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern\r\ngales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\r\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.\r\n\n\r\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.\r\nOne or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which\r\nexperienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content\r\nif nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\r\n\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I\r\nwill not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.\r\n\n\r\nBut success shall crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have\r\ngone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves\r\nbeing witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the\r\nuntamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved\r\nwill of man?\r\n\n\r\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish.\r\nHeaven bless my beloved sister!\r\n\n\r\nR.W.\r\n\n\nTo Mrs. Saville, England.\n\n\r\nAugust 5th, 17\u2014.\r\n\n\r\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it,\r\nalthough it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come\r\ninto your possession.\r\n\n\r\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the\r\nship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our\r\nsituation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a\r\nvery thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place\r\nin the atmosphere and weather.\r\n\n\r\nAbout two o\u2019clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every\r\ndirection, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some\r\nof my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious\r\nthoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted\r\nour solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a\r\nsledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a\r\nmile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\r\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the\r\ntraveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities\r\nof the ice.\r\n\n\r\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many\r\nhundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was\r\nnot, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it\r\nwas impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest\r\nattention.\r\n\n\r\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night\r\nthe ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning,\r\nfearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about\r\nafter the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few\r\nhours.\r\n\n\r\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found\r\nall the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone\r\nin the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had\r\ndrifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog\r\nremained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were\r\npersuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to\r\nbe, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I\r\nappeared on deck the master said, \u201cHere is our captain, and he will not allow\r\nyou to perish on the open sea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign\r\naccent. \u201cBefore I come on board your vessel,\u201d said he, \u201cwill you have the\r\nkindness to inform me whither you are bound?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me\r\nfrom a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that\r\nmy vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the\r\nmost precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on\r\na voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.\r\n\n\r\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. Good\r\nGod! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety,\r\nyour surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his\r\nbody dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so\r\nwretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as\r\nhe had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the\r\ndeck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him\r\nto swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him\r\nup in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow\r\ndegrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.\r\n\n\r\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared\r\nthat his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some\r\nmeasure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as\r\nmy duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have\r\ngenerally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments\r\nwhen, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the\r\nmost trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a\r\nbeam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is\r\ngenerally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if\r\nimpatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\r\n\n\r\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men,\r\nwho wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be\r\ntormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose\r\nrestoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the\r\nlieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.\r\n\n\r\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he\r\nreplied, \u201cTo seek one who fled from me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some\r\ndogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis aroused the stranger\u2019s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions\r\nconcerning the route which the d\u00e6mon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon\r\nafter, when he was alone with me, he said, \u201cI have, doubtless, excited your\r\ncuriosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to\r\nmake inquiries.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble\r\nyou with any inquisitiveness of mine.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\r\nbenevolently restored me to life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had\r\ndestroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree\r\nof certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller\r\nmight have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could\r\nnot judge.\r\n\n\r\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\r\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the\r\nsledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the\r\ncabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have\r\npromised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any\r\nnew object should appear in sight.\r\n\n\r\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present\r\nday. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and\r\nappears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are\r\nso conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although\r\nthey have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to\r\nlove him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy\r\nand compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being\r\neven now in wreck so attractive and amiable.\r\n\n\r\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on\r\nthe wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken\r\nby misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my\r\nheart.\r\n\n\r\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have\r\nany fresh incidents to record.\r\n\n\r\nAugust 13th, 17\u2014.\r\n\n\r\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration\r\nand my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature\r\ndestroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle,\r\nyet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words\r\nare culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled\r\neloquence.\r\n\n\r\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\r\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\r\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests\r\nhimself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me\r\non mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered\r\nattentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into\r\nevery minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led\r\nby the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give\r\nutterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour\r\nthat warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every\r\nhope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man\u2019s life or death were but a\r\nsmall price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the\r\ndominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As\r\nI spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener\u2019s countenance. At first I\r\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his\r\neyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from\r\nbetween his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length\r\nhe spoke, in broken accents: \u201cUnhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you\r\ndrunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you\r\nwill dash the cup from your lips!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of\r\ngrief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours\r\nof repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.\r\n\n\r\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself\r\nfor being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he\r\nled me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history\r\nof my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains\r\nof reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a\r\nmore intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and\r\nexpressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not\r\nenjoy this blessing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI agree with you,\u201d replied the stranger; \u201cwe are unfashioned creatures, but\r\nhalf made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves\u2014such a friend ought\r\nto be\u2014do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once\r\nhad a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to\r\njudge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have\r\nno cause for despair. But I\u2014I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that\r\ntouched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.\r\n\n\r\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the\r\nbeauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these\r\nwonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from\r\nearth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be\r\noverwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will\r\nbe like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no\r\ngrief or folly ventures.\r\n\n\r\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You\r\nwould not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and\r\nretirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this\r\nonly renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this\r\nwonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is\r\nwhich he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I\r\never knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but\r\nnever-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things,\r\nunequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression\r\nand a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\r\n\n\r\nAugust 19th, 17\u2014.\r\n\n\r\nYesterday the stranger said to me, \u201cYou may easily perceive, Captain Walton,\r\nthat I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at\r\none time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me\r\nto alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did;\r\nand I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent\r\nto sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters\r\nwill be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\r\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am,\r\nI imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct\r\nyou if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.\r\nPrepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we\r\namong the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief,\r\nperhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and\r\nmysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with\r\nthe ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in\r\nits series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is\r\ncomposed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication,\r\nyet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his\r\nmisfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative,\r\npartly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if\r\nit were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d he replied, \u201cfor your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is\r\nnearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I\r\nunderstand your feeling,\u201d continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt\r\nhim; \u201cbut you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you;\r\nnothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how\r\nirrevocably it is determined.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should\r\nbe at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved\r\nevery night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as\r\nnearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I\r\nshould be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless\r\nafford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from\r\nhis own lips\u2014with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future\r\nday! Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears;\r\nhis lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his\r\nthin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated\r\nby the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the\r\nstorm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it\u2014thus!\r\n\n\r\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of\r\nthat republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics,\r\nand my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.\r\nHe was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable\r\nattention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied\r\nby the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\r\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband\r\nand the father of a family.\r\n\n\r\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain\r\nfrom relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a\r\nflourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man,\r\nwhose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not\r\nbear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly\r\nbeen distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\r\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the\r\ntown of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved\r\nBeaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in\r\nthese unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led\r\nhis friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He\r\nlost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him\r\nto begin the world again through his credit and assistance.\r\n\n\r\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months\r\nbefore my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened\r\nto the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he\r\nentered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very\r\nsmall sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to\r\nprovide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to\r\nprocure some respectable employment in a merchant\u2019s house. The interval was,\r\nconsequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling\r\nwhen he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his\r\nmind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of\r\nany exertion.\r\n\n\r\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with\r\ndespair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no\r\nother prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an\r\nuncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She\r\nprocured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a\r\npittance scarcely sufficient to support life.\r\n\n\r\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more\r\nentirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in\r\nthe tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a\r\nbeggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort\u2019s coffin weeping\r\nbitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit\r\nto the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of\r\nhis friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\r\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\r\n\n\r\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this\r\ncircumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.\r\nThere was a sense of justice in my father\u2019s upright mind which rendered it\r\nnecessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former\r\nyears he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and\r\nso was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of\r\ngratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\r\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a\r\ndesire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she\r\nhad endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.\r\nEverything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to\r\nshelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher\r\nwind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion\r\nin her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her\r\nhitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\r\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\r\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their\r\nunion they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and\r\ninterest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for\r\nher weakened frame.\r\n\n\r\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at\r\nNaples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for\r\nseveral years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they\r\nseemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to\r\nbestow them upon me. My mother\u2019s tender caresses and my father\u2019s smile of\r\nbenevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their\r\nplaything and their idol, and something better\u2014their child, the innocent and\r\nhelpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and\r\nwhose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery,\r\naccording as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep\r\nconsciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life,\r\nadded to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined\r\nthat while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience,\r\nof charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all\r\nseemed but one train of enjoyment to me.\r\n\n\r\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\r\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years\r\nold, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a\r\nweek on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made\r\nthem enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty;\r\nit was a necessity, a passion\u2014remembering what she had suffered, and how she\r\nhad been relieved\u2014for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\r\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\r\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of\r\nhalf-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One\r\nday, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me,\r\nvisited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down\r\nby care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among\r\nthese there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She\r\nappeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little\r\nvagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living\r\ngold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of\r\ndistinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless,\r\nand her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and\r\nsweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct\r\nspecies, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her\r\nfeatures.\r\n\n\r\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\r\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not\r\nher child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and\r\nhad died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people\r\nto nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their\r\neldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those\r\nItalians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy\u2014one among the\r\nschiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his\r\ncountry. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still\r\nlingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was\r\nconfiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her\r\nfoster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among\r\ndark-leaved brambles.\r\n\n\r\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our\r\nvilla a child fairer than pictured cherub\u2014a creature who seemed to shed\r\nradiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the\r\nchamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my\r\nmother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They\r\nwere fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but\r\nit would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence\r\nafforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and\r\nthe result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents\u2019 house\u2014my\r\nmore than sister\u2014the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\r\nmy pleasures.\r\n\n\r\nEveryone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with\r\nwhich all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On\r\nthe evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said\r\nplayfully, \u201cI have a pretty present for my Victor\u2014tomorrow he shall have it.\u201d\r\nAnd when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I,\r\nwith childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon\r\nElizabeth as mine\u2014mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\r\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\r\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the\r\nkind of relation in which she stood to me\u2014my more than sister, since till death\r\nshe was to be mine only.\r\n\n\r\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages.\r\nI need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.\r\nHarmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that\r\nsubsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer\r\nand more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a\r\nmore intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for\r\nknowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\r\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home \u2014the\r\nsublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm,\r\nthe silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers\u2014she\r\nfound ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated\r\nwith a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I\r\ndelighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I\r\ndesired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of\r\nnature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\r\nearliest sensations I can remember.\r\n\n\r\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up\r\nentirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We\r\npossessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern\r\nshore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.\r\nWe resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed\r\nin considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach\r\nmyself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows\r\nin general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one\r\namong them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of\r\nsingular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\r\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed\r\nheroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly\r\nadventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in\r\nwhich the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round\r\nTable of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem\r\nthe holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\r\n\n\r\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents\r\nwere possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they\r\nwere not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents\r\nand creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with\r\nother families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and\r\ngratitude assisted the development of filial love.\r\n\n\r\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in\r\nmy temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager\r\ndesire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that\r\nneither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the\r\npolitics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of\r\nheaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward\r\nsubstance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of\r\nman that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or\r\nin its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of\r\nthings. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men\r\nwere his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose\r\nnames are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our\r\nspecies. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in\r\nour peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet\r\nglance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\r\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in\r\nmy study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to\r\nsubdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval\u2014could aught ill\r\nentrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so\r\nperfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and\r\ntenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to\r\nhim the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim\r\nof his soaring ambition.\r\n\n\r\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before\r\nmisfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive\r\nusefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing\r\nthe picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by\r\ninsensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to\r\nmyself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find\r\nit arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources;\r\nbut, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has\r\nswept away all my hopes and joys.\r\n\n\r\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\r\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection\r\nfor that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of\r\npleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to\r\nremain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of\r\nthe works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he\r\nattempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed\r\nthis feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and\r\nbounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked\r\ncarelessly at the title page of my book and said, \u201cAh! Cornelius Agrippa! My\r\ndear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that\r\nthe principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system\r\nof science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the\r\nancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the\r\nformer were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly\r\nhave thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was,\r\nby returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible that\r\nthe train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to\r\nmy ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means\r\nassured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read\r\nwith the greatest avidity.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\r\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied\r\nthe wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures\r\nknown to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been\r\nimbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of\r\nthe intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always\r\ncame from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to\r\nhave avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and\r\nunexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural\r\nphilosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy\u2019s apprehensions\r\nas tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\r\n\n\r\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with\r\ntheir practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had\r\npartially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a\r\nwonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to\r\nspeak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were\r\nutterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments\r\nthat seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and\r\nrashly and ignorantly I had repined.\r\n\n\r\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.\r\nI took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It\r\nmay appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while\r\nI followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great\r\ndegree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not\r\nscientific, and I was left to struggle with a child\u2019s blindness, added to a\r\nstudent\u2019s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I\r\nentered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher\u2019s stone\r\nand the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.\r\nWealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I\r\ncould banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any\r\nbut a violent death!\r\n\n\r\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise\r\nliberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most\r\neagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed\r\nthe failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill\r\nor fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded\r\nsystems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and\r\nfloundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by\r\nan ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed\r\nthe current of my ideas.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive,\r\nwhen we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from\r\nbehind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful\r\nloudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm\r\nlasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the\r\ndoor, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak\r\nwhich stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling\r\nlight vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted\r\nstump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a\r\nsingular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to\r\nthin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.\r\n\n\r\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.\r\nOn this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and\r\nexcited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he\r\nhad formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new\r\nand astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\r\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed\r\nstudies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that\r\nhad so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those\r\ncaprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at\r\nonce gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its\r\nprogeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest\r\ndisdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold\r\nof real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and\r\nthe branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure\r\nfoundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\r\n\n\r\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we\r\nbound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost\r\nmiraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the\r\nguardian angel of my life\u2014the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to\r\navert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop\r\nme. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul\r\nwhich followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.\r\nIt was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution,\r\nhappiness with their disregard.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. Destiny\r\nwas too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible\r\ndestruction.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should\r\nbecome a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the\r\nschools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my\r\neducation that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my\r\nnative country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before\r\nthe day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred\u2014an\r\nomen, as it were, of my future misery.\r\n\n\r\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in\r\nthe greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\r\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded\r\nto our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was\r\nmenaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her\r\nwatchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper\u2014Elizabeth was\r\nsaved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On\r\nthe third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most\r\nalarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the\r\nworst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women\r\ndid not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. \u201cMy\r\nchildren,\u201d she said, \u201cmy firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the\r\nprospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your\r\nfather. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.\r\nAlas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been,\r\nis it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will\r\nendeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of\r\nmeeting you in another world.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need\r\nnot describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most\r\nirreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair\r\nthat is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can\r\npersuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence\r\nappeared a part of our own can have departed for ever\u2014that the brightness of a\r\nbeloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and\r\ndear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the\r\nreflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of\r\nthe evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not\r\nthat rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a\r\nsorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when\r\ngrief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon\r\nthe lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was\r\ndead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our\r\ncourse with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains\r\nwhom the spoiler has not seized.\r\n\n\r\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now\r\nagain determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It\r\nappeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the\r\nhouse of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but\r\nit did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that\r\nremained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some\r\ndegree consoled.\r\n\n\r\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She\r\nlooked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She\r\ndevoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and\r\ncousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the\r\nsunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret\r\nin her endeavours to make us forget.\r\n\n\r\nThe day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with\r\nus. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and\r\nto become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader\r\nand saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry\r\ndeeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said\r\nlittle, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance\r\na restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\n\r\nWe sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade\r\nourselves to say the word \u201cFarewell!\u201d It was said, and we retired under the\r\npretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when\r\nat morning\u2019s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they\r\nwere all there\u2014my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more,\r\nmy Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the\r\nlast feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\r\n\n\r\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the\r\nmost melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable\r\ncompanions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure\u2014I was\r\nnow alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and\r\nbe my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and\r\ndomestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I\r\nloved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were \u201cold familiar faces,\u201d but\r\nI believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my\r\nreflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes\r\nrose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at\r\nhome, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\r\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my\r\ndesires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.\r\n\n\r\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey\r\nto Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple\r\nof the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment\r\nto spend the evening as I pleased.\r\n\n\r\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\r\nsome of the principal professors. Chance\u2014or rather the evil influence, the\r\nAngel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I\r\nturned my reluctant steps from my father\u2019s door\u2014led me first to M. Krempe,\r\nprofessor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in\r\nthe secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my\r\nprogress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural\r\nphilosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names\r\nof my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared.\r\n\u201cHave you,\u201d he said, \u201creally spent your time in studying such nonsense?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI replied in the affirmative. \u201cEvery minute,\u201d continued M. Krempe with warmth,\r\n\u201cevery instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely\r\nlost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.\r\nGood God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to\r\ninform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand\r\nyears old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this\r\nenlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and\r\nParacelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of\r\nnatural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after\r\nmentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence\r\na course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that\r\nM. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days\r\nthat he omitted.\r\n\n\r\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered\r\nthose authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all\r\nthe more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a\r\nlittle squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher,\r\ntherefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too\r\nphilosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the\r\nconclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had\r\nnot been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\r\nscience. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth\r\nand my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge\r\nalong the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for\r\nthe dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of\r\nmodern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the\r\nscience sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand;\r\nbut now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\r\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was\r\nchiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for\r\nrealities of little worth.\r\n\n\r\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at\r\nIngolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities\r\nand the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced,\r\nI thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the\r\nlectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited\r\nfellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\r\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\r\n\n\r\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room,\r\nwhich M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his\r\ncolleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive\r\nof the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at\r\nthe back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably\r\nerect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a\r\nrecapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by\r\ndifferent men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most\r\ndistinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of\r\nthe science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few\r\npreparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry,\r\nthe terms of which I shall never forget:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ancient teachers of this science,\u201d said he, \u201cpromised impossibilities and\r\nperformed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that\r\nmetals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these\r\nphilosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to\r\npore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They\r\npenetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her\r\nhiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood\r\ncirculates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and\r\nalmost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the\r\nearthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuch were the professor\u2019s words\u2014rather let me say such the words of the\r\nfate\u2014enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling\r\nwith a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed\r\nthe mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was\r\nfilled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done,\r\nexclaimed the soul of Frankenstein\u2014more, far more, will I achieve; treading in\r\nthe steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\r\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\r\n\n\r\nI closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\r\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no\r\npower to produce it. By degrees, after the morning\u2019s dawn, sleep came. I awoke,\r\nand my yesternight\u2019s thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution\r\nto return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I\r\nbelieved myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman\r\na visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in\r\npublic, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\r\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him\r\npretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his\r\nfellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my\r\nstudies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but\r\nwithout the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that \u201cThese were men\r\nto whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the\r\nfoundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give\r\nnew names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\r\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men\r\nof genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately\r\nturning to the solid advantage of mankind.\u201d I listened to his statement, which\r\nwas delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his\r\nlecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself\r\nin measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\r\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me\r\nashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I\r\nrequested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am happy,\u201d said M. Waldman, \u201cto have gained a disciple; and if your\r\napplication equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is\r\nthat branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been\r\nand may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study;\r\nbut at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man\r\nwould make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human\r\nknowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not\r\nmerely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of\r\nnatural philosophy, including mathematics.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various\r\nmachines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use\r\nof his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange\r\ntheir mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I\r\ntook my leave.\r\n\n\r\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\r\n\n\r\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most\r\ncomprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with\r\nardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern\r\ninquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and\r\ncultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I\r\nfound even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information,\r\ncombined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that\r\naccount the less valuable", "summary": "\nThe text consists of letters written by Robert Walton to his sister Margaret, followed by the beginning of Victor Frankenstein's narrative. Walton is on an expedition to the North Pole, driven by ambition and a thirst for knowledge. He writes to his sister from St. Petersburg and later from Archangel, describing his excitement about the voyage and his determination to discover new lands and phenomena despite the dangers.\nWalton expresses loneliness and a desire for a true friend who can understand his passion for discovery. During his voyage, his ship becomes trapped in ice, and the crew witnesses a gigantic figure on a dog-drawn sledge in the distance. The next day, they rescue a man nearly frozen to death who was pursuing the figure they had seen. The man, Victor Frankenstein, gradually recovers and develops a bond with Walton, recognizing in him the same dangerous ambition that led to his own downfall.\nAfter some time, Frankenstein decides to tell Walton his story as a cautionary tale. He begins by describing his childhood in Geneva in a loving, privileged family. His parents adopted Elizabeth Lavenza, a beautiful orphan who became his close companion. Victor also forms a deep friendship with Henry Clerval, who shares his passion for knowledge but is more interested in human affairs than scientific pursuits.\nFrom a young age, Victor is fascinated by the mysteries of nature and the secrets of life. He becomes obsessed with the works of alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa, despite his father's dismissal of these as outdated. A pivotal moment occurs when Victor witnesses lightning destroy a tree, and a scientist explains electricity to him, throwing his previous studies into question.\nBefore Victor leaves for university at Ingolstadt, his mother dies after nursing Elizabeth through scarlet fever. At university, Professor Krempe harshly criticizes Victor's interest in the alchemists, but Professor Waldman inspires him with a lecture about how modern scientists have made remarkable discoveries about nature's workings. This ignites Victor's ambition to go further, to \"unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\"\nVictor describes how he immerses himself in scientific study, particularly chemistry. Professor Waldman becomes his mentor, encouraging him to pursue a broad scientific education rather than narrow specialization. Victor dedicates himself to his studies with intense focus and determination.\nThe narrative ends as Victor is establishing himself at university and beginning the scientific journey that will eventually lead him to create his monster, foreshadowing the tragic events to come. The text captures the themes of dangerous ambition, the pursuit of forbidden knowledge, and the responsibility that comes with scientific discovery.\n", "map": [["Walton", "pursues dangerous Arctic expedition"], ["Victor", "warns against unbridled ambition"], ["dangerous knowledge", "leads to destruction"], ["scientific pursuit", "crosses ethical boundaries"], ["Walton", "seeks understanding companion"], ["Victor", "mentored by Professor Waldman"], ["lightning strike", "transforms Victor's scientific understanding"], ["alchemists", "inspire Victor's initial studies"], ["modern science", "replaces ancient knowledge"], ["creature", "pursued across frozen wasteland"], ["Elizabeth", "represents domestic happiness"], ["Clerval", "balances human concerns with ambition"], ["Victor's mother", "dies from selfless caretaking"], ["Victor", "shares cautionary tale"], ["Victor's childhood", "shapes scientific fascination"], ["framing narrative", "reinforces impending tragedy"]]}
