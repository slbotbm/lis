I will not be offended at my idle, thoughtless fairies, for they have taught me a new way of doing good.\u201d When the frost fairies heard these words they crept, one by one, from their corners, and, kneeling down before their master, confessed their fault, and asked his pardon. He frowned upon them for awhile, and scolded them, too, but he soon relented, and said he would forgive them this time, and would only punish them by making them carry more treasure to the forest, and hide it in the trees, until all the leaves, with Mr.\u00a0Sun\u2019s help, were covered with gold and ruby coats.\nThen the fairies thanked him for his forgiveness, and promised to work very hard to please him; and the good-natured king took them all up in his arms, and carried them safely home to his palace. From that time, I suppose, it has been part of Jack Frost\u2019s work to paint the trees with the glowing colours we see in the autumn; and if they are not covered with gold and precious stones, I do not know how he makes them so bright; do you?\nThe Frost King by Helen A. Keller\nKing Frost lives in a beautiful palace far to the North, in the land of perpetual snow. The palace, which is magnificent beyond description, was built centuries ago, in the reign of King Glacier. At a little distance from the palace we might easily mistake it for a mountain whose peaks were mounting heavenward to receive the last kiss of the departing day. But on nearer approach we should discover our error. What we had supposed to be peaks were in reality a thousand glittering spires. Nothing could be more beautiful than the architecture of this ice-palace. The walls are curiously constructed of massive blocks of ice which terminate in cliff-like towers. The entrance to the palace is at the end of an arched recess, and it is guarded night and day by twelve soldierly-looking white Bears.\nBut, children, you must make King Frost a visit the very first opportunity you have, and see for yourselves this wonderful palace. The old King will welcome you kindly, for he loves children, and it is his chief delight to give them pleasure.\nYou must know that King Frost, like all other kings, has great treasures of gold and precious stones; but as he is a generous old monarch, he endeavours to make a right use of his riches. So wherever he goes he does many wonderful works; he builds bridges over every stream, as transparent as glass, but often as strong as iron; he shakes the forest trees until the ripe nuts fall into the laps of laughing children; he puts the flowers to sleep with one touch of his hand; then, lest we should mourn for the bright faces of the flowers, he paints the leaves with gold and crimson and emerald, and when his task is done the trees are beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer. I will tell you how King Frost happened to think of painting the leaves, for it is a strange story.\nOne day while King Frost was surveying his vast wealth and thinking what good he could do with it, he suddenly bethought him of his jolly old neighbour, Santa Claus. \u201cI will send my treasures to Santa Claus,\u201d said the King to himself. \u201cHe is the very man to dispose of them satisfactorily, for he knows where the poor and the unhappy live, and his kind old heart is always full of benevolent plans for their relief.\u201d So he called together the merry little fairies of his household and, showing them the jars and vases containing his treasures, he bade them carry them to the palace of Santa Claus as quickly as they could. The fairies promised obedience, and were off in a twinkling, dragging the heavy jars and vases along after them as well as they could, now and then grumbling a little at having such a hard task, for they were idle fairies and loved to play better than to work. After awhile they came to a great forest and, being tired and hungry, they thought they would rest a little and look for nuts before continuing their journey. But thinking their treasure might be stolen from them, they hid the jars among the thick green leaves of the various trees until they were sure that no one could find them. Then they began to wander merrily about searching for nuts, climbing trees, peeping curiously into the empty birds\u2019 nests, and playing hide and seek from behind the trees. Now, these naughty fairies were so busy and so merry over their frolic that they forgot all about their errand and their master\u2019s command to go quickly, but soon they found to their dismay why they had been bidden to hasten, for although they had, as they supposed, hidden the treasure carefully, yet the bright eyes of King Sun had spied out the jars among the leaves, and as he and King Frost could never agree as to what was the best way of benefiting the world, he was very glad of a good opportunity of playing a joke upon his rather sharp rival. King Sun laughed softly to himself when the delicate jars began to melt and break. At length every jar and vase was cracked or broken, and the precious stones they contained were melting, too, and running in little streams over the trees and bushes of the forest.\nStill the idle fairies did not notice what was happening, for they were down on the grass, and the wonderful shower of treasure was a long time in reaching them; but at last they plainly heard the tinkling of many drops falling like rain through the forest, and sliding from leaf to leaf until they reached the little bushes by their side, when to their astonishment they discovered that the raindrops were melted rubies which hardened on the leaves, and turned them to crimson and gold in a moment. Then looking around more closely, they saw that much of the treasure was already melted, for the oaks and maples were arrayed in gorgeous dresses of gold and crimson and emerald. It was very beautiful, but the disobedient fairies were too frightened to notice the beauty of the trees. They were afraid that King Frost would come and punish them. So they hid themselves among the bushes and waited silently for something to happen. Their fears were well founded, for their long absence had alarmed the King, and he mounted North Wind and went out in search of his tardy couriers. Of course, he had not gone far when he noticed the brightness of the leaves, and he quickly guessed the cause when he saw the broken jars from which the treasure was still dropping. At first King Frost was very angry, and the fairies trembled and crouched lower in their hiding-places, and I do not know what might have happened to them if just then a party of boys and girls had not entered the wood. When the children saw the trees all aglow with brilliant colors they clapped their hands and shouted for joy, and immediately began to pick great bunches to take home. \u201cThe leaves are as lovely as the flowers!\u201d cried they, in their delight. Their pleasure banished the anger from King Frost\u2019s heart and the frown from his brow, and he, too, began to admire the painted trees. He said to himself, \u201cMy treasures are not wasted if they make little children happy. My idle fairies and my fiery enemy have taught me a new way of doing good.\u201d\nWhen the fairies heard this, they were greatly relieved and came forth from their hiding-places, confessed their fault, and asked their master\u2019s forgiveness.\nEver since that time it has been King Frost\u2019s great delight to paint the leaves with the glowing colors we see in the autumn, and if they are not covered with gold and precious stones I cannot imagine what makes them so bright, can you?\nIf the story of \u201cThe Frost Fairies\u201d was read to Helen in the summer of 1888, she could not have understood very much of it at that time, for she had only been under instruction since March, 1887.\nCan it be that the language of the story had remained dormant in her mind until my description of the beauty of the autumn scenery in 1891 brought it vividly before her mental vision?\nI have made careful investigation among Helen\u2019s friends in Alabama and in Boston and its vicinity, but thus far have been unable to ascertain any later date when it could have been read to her.\nAnother fact is of great significance in this connection. \u201cThe Rose Fairies\u201d was published in the same volume with \u201cThe Frost Fairies,\u201d and, therefore, was probably read to Helen at or about the same time.\nNow Helen, in her letter of February, 1890 (quoted above), alludes to this story of Miss Canby\u2019s as a dream \u201cwhich I had a long time ago when I was a very little child.\u201d Surely, a year and a half would appear \u201ca long time ago\u201d to a little girl like Helen; we therefore have reason to believe that the stories must have been read to her at least as early as the summer of 1888.\nHelen Keller\u2019s Own Statement\n(The following entry made by Helen in her diary speaks for itself.)\n1892. January 30. This morning I took a bath, and when teacher came upstairs to comb my hair she told me some very sad news which made me unhappy all day. Someone wrote to Mr.\u00a0Anagnos that the story which I sent him as a birthday gift, and which I wrote myself, was not my story at all, but that a lady had written it a long time ago. The person said her story was called \u201cFrost Fairies.\u201d I am sure I never heard it. It made us feel so bad to think that people thought we had been untrue and wicked. My heart was full of tears, for I love the beautiful truth with my whole heart and mind.\nIt troubles me greatly now. I do not know what I shall do. I never thought that people could make such mistakes. I am perfectly sure I wrote the story myself. Mr.\u00a0Anagnos is much troubled. It grieves me to think that I have been the cause of his unhappiness, but of course I did not mean to do it.\nI thought about my story in the autumn, because teacher told me about the autumn leaves while we walked in the woods at Fern Quarry. I thought fairies must have painted them because they are so wonderful, and I thought, too, that King Frost must have jars and vases containing precious treasures, because I knew that other kings long ago had, and because teacher told me that the leaves were painted ruby, emerald, gold, crimson, and brown; so that I thought the paint must be melted stones. I knew that they must make children happy because they are so lovely, and it made me very happy to think that the leaves were so beautiful and that the trees glowed so, although I could not see them.\nI thought everybody had the same thought about the leaves, but I do not know now. I thought very much about the sad news when teacher went to the doctor\u2019s; she was not here at dinner and I missed her.\nI do not feel that I can add anything more that will be of interest. My own heart is too \u201cfull of tears\u201d when I remember how my dear little pupil suffered when she knew \u201cthat people thought we had been untrue and wicked,\u201d for I know that she does indeed \u201clove the beautiful truth with her whole heart and mind.\u201d\nYours truly,\nAnnie M. Sullivan.\nSo much appears in the Volta Bureau Souvenir. The following letter from Mr.\u00a0Anagnos is reprinted from the American Annals of the Deaf, April, 1892:\nPerkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind\nSo. Boston, March 11, 1892.\nTo the Editor of the Annals.\nSir: In compliance with your wishes I make the following statement concerning Helen Keller\u2019s story of \u201cKing Frost.\u201d It was sent to me as a birthday gift on November 7th, from Tuscumbia, Alabama. Knowing as well as I do Helen\u2019s extraordinary abilities I did not hesitate to accept it as her own work; nor do I doubt today that she is fully capable of writing such a composition. Soon after its appearance in print I was pained to learn, through the Goodson Gazette, that a portion of the story (eight or nine passages) is either a reproduction or adaptation of Miss Margaret Canby\u2019s \u201cFrost Fairies.\u201d I immediately instituted an inquiry to ascertain the facts in the case. None of our teachers or officers who are accustomed to converse with Helen ever knew or heard about Miss Canby\u2019s book, nor did the child\u2019s parents and relatives at home have any knowledge of it. Her father, Captain Keller, wrote to me as follows on the subject:\n\u201cI hasten to assure you that Helen could not have received any idea of the story from any of her relations or friends here, none of whom can communicate with her readily enough to impress her with the details of a story of that character.\u201d\nAt my request, one of the teachers in the girls\u2019 department examined Helen in regard to the construction of the story. Her testimony is as follows:\n\u201cI first tried to ascertain what had suggested to Helen\u2019s mind the particular fancies which made her story seem like a reproduction of one written by Miss Margaret Canby. Helen told me that for a long time she had thought of Jack Frost as a king, because of the many treasures which he possessed. Such rich treasures must be kept in a safe place, and so she had imagined them stored in jars and vases in one part of the royal palace. She said that one autumn day her teacher told her as they were walking together in the woods, about the many beautiful colours of the leaves, and she had thought that such beauty must make people very happy, and very grateful to King Frost. I asked Helen what stories she had read about Jack Frost. In answer to my question she recited a part of the poem called \u2018Freaks of the Frost,\u2019 and she referred to a little piece about winter, in one of the school readers. She could not remember that anyone had ever read to her any stories about King Frost, but said she had talked with her teacher about Jack Frost and the wonderful things he did.\u201d\nThe only person that we supposed might possibly have read the story to Helen was her friend, Mrs.\u00a0Hopkins, whom she was visiting at the time in Brewster. I asked Miss Sullivan to go at once to see Mrs.\u00a0Hopkins and ascertain the facts in the matter. The result of her investigation is embodied in the printed note herewith enclosed.28\nI have scarcely any doubt that Miss Canby\u2019s little book was read to Helen, by Mrs.\u00a0Hopkins, in the summer of 1888. But the child has no recollection whatever of this fact. On Miss Sullivan\u2019s return to Brewster, she read to Helen the story of Little Lord Fauntleroy, which she had purchased in Boston for the purpose. The child was at once fascinated and absorbed with the charming story, which evidently made a deeper impression upon her mind than any previously read to her, as was shown in the frequent reference to it, both in her conversation and letters, for many months afterward. Her intense interest in Fauntleroy must have buried all remembrance of \u201cFrost Fairies,\u201d and when, more than three years later, she had acquired a fuller knowledge and use of language, and was told of Jack Frost and his work, the seed so long buried sprang up into new thoughts and fancies. This may explain the reason why Helen claims persistently that \u201cThe Frost King\u201d is her own story. She seems to have some idea of the difference between original composition and reproduction. She did not know the meaning of the word \u201cplagiarism\u201d until quite recently, when it was explained to her. She is absolutely truthful. Veracity is the strongest element of her character. She was very much surprised and grieved when she was told that her composition was an adaptation of Miss Canby\u2019s story of \u201cFrost Fairies.\u201d She could not keep back her tears, and the chief cause of her pain seemed to be the fear lest people should doubt her truthfulness. She said, with great intensity of feeling, \u201cI love the beautiful truth.\u201d A most rigid examination of the child of about two hours\u2019 duration, at which eight persons were present and asked all sorts of questions with perfect freedom, failed to elicit in the least any testimony convicting either her teacher or anyone else of the intention or attempt to practice deception.\nIn view of these facts I cannot but think that Helen, while writing \u201cThe Frost King,\u201d was entirely unconscious of ever having had the story of \u201cFrost Fairies\u201d read to her, and that her memory has been accompanied by such a loss of associations that she herself honestly believed her composition to be original. This theory is shared by many persons who are perfectly well acquainted with the child and who are able to rise above the clouds of a narrow prejudice.\nVery sincerely yours,\nM. Anagnos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDirector of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind.\nThe episode had a deadening effect on Helen Keller and on Miss Sullivan, who feared that she had allowed the habit of imitation, which has in truth made Miss Keller a writer, to go too far. Even today, when Miss Keller strikes off a fine phrase, Miss Sullivan says in humorous despair, \u201cI wonder where she got that?\u201d But she knows now, since she has studied with her pupil in college the problems of composition, under the wise advice of Mr.\u00a0Charles T. Copeland, that the style of every writer and indeed, of every human being, illiterate or cultivated, is a composite reminiscence of all that he has read and heard. Of the sources of his vocabulary he is, for the most part, as unaware as he is of the moment when he ate the food which makes a bit of his thumbnail. With most of us the contributions from different sources are blended, crossed and confused. A child with but few sources may keep distinct what he draws from each. In this case Helen Keller held almost intact in her mind, unmixed with other ideas, the words of a story which at the time it was read to her she did not fully understand. The importance of this cannot be overestimated. It shows how the child-mind gathers into itself words it has heard, and how they lurk there ready to come out when the key that releases the spring is touched. The reason that we do not observe this process in ordinary children is, because we seldom observe them at all, and because they are fed from so many sources that the memories are confused and mutually destructive. The story of \u201cThe Frost King\u201d did not, however, come from Helen Keller\u2019s mind intact, but had taken to itself the mould of the child\u2019s temperament and had drawn on a vocabulary that to some extent had been supplied in other ways. The style of her version is in some respects even better than the style of Miss Canby\u2019s story. It has the imaginative credulity of a primitive folktale; whereas Miss Canby\u2019s story is evidently told for children by an older person, who adopts the manner of a fairy tale and cannot conceal the mature mood which allows such didactic phrases as \u201cJack Frost as he is sometimes called,\u201d \u201cNoon, at which time Mr.\u00a0Sun is strongest.\u201d Most people will feel the superior imaginative quality of Helen Keller\u2019s opening paragraph. Surely the writer must become as a little child to see things like that. \u201cTwelve soldierly-looking white bears\u201d is a stroke of genius, and there is beauty of rhythm throughout the child\u2019s narrative. It is original in the same way that a poet\u2019s version of an old story is original.\nThis little story calls into life all the questions of language and the philosophy of style. Some conclusions may be briefly suggested.\nAll use of language is imitative, and one\u2019s style is made up of all other styles that one has met.\nThe way to write good English is to read it and hear it. Thus it is that any child may be taught to use correct English by not being allowed to read or hear any other kind. In a child, the selection of the better from the worse is not conscious; he is the servant of his word experience.\nThe ordinary man will never be rid of the fallacy that words obey thought, that one thinks first and phrases afterward. There must first, it is true, be the intention, the desire to utter something, but the idea does not often become specific, does not take shape until it is phrased; certainly an idea is a different thing by virtue of being phrased. Words often make the thought, and the master of words will say things greater than are in him. A remarkable example is a paragraph from Miss Keller\u2019s sketch in the Youth\u2019s Companion. Writing of the moment when she learned that everything has a name, she says: \u201cWe met the nurse carrying my little cousin; and teacher spelled \u2018baby.\u2019 And for the first time I was impressed with the smallness and helplessness of a little baby, and mingled with the thought there was another one of myself, and I was glad I was myself, and not a baby.\u201d It was a word that created these thoughts in her mind. So the master of words is master of thoughts which the words create, and says things greater than he could otherwise know. Helen Keller writing \u201cThe Frost King\u201d was building better than she knew and saying more than she meant.\nWhoever makes a sentence of words utters not his wisdom, but the wisdom of the race whose life is in the words, though they have never been so grouped before. The man who can write stories thinks of stories to write. The medium calls forth the thing it conveys, and the greater the medium the deeper the thoughts.\nThe educated man is the man whose expression is educated. The substance of thought is language, and language is the one thing to teach the deaf child and every other child. Let him get language and he gets the very stuff that language is made of, the thought and the experience of his race. The language must be one used by a nation, not an artificial thing. Volap\u00fck is a paradox, unless one has French or English or German or some other language that has grown up in a nation. The deaf child who has only the sign language of De l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e is an intellectual Philip Nolan, an alien from all races, and his thoughts are not the thoughts of an Englishman, or a Frenchman, or a Spaniard. The Lord\u2019s prayer in signs is not the Lord\u2019s prayer in English.\nIn his essay on style De Quincey says that the best English is to be found in the letters of the cultivated gentlewoman, because she has read only a few good books and has not been corrupted by the style of newspapers and the jargon of street, marketplace, and assembly hall.\nPrecisely these outward circumstances account for Helen Keller\u2019s use of English. In the early years of her education she had only good things to read; some were, indeed, trivial and not excellent in style, but not one was positively bad in manner or substance. This happy condition has obtained throughout her life. She has been nurtured on imaginative literature, and she has gathered from it into her vigorous and tenacious memory the style of great writers. \u201cA new word opens its heart to me,\u201d she writes in a letter; and when she uses the word its heart is still open. When she was twelve years old, she was asked what book she would take on a long railroad journey. Paradise Lost, she answered, and she read it on the train.\nUntil the last year or two she has not been master of her style, rather has her style been master of her. It is only since she has made composition a more conscious study that she has ceased to be the victim of the phrase; the lucky victim, fortunately, of the good phrase.\nWhen in 1892, she was encouraged to write a sketch of her life for the Youth\u2019s Companion, in the hope that it would reassure her and help her to recover from the effect of \u201cThe Frost King,\u201d she produced a piece of composition which is much more remarkable and in itself more entertaining at some points than the corresponding part of her story in this book. When she came to retell the story in a fuller form, the echo was still in her mind of the phrases she had written nine years before. Yet she had not seen her sketch in the Youth\u2019s Companion since she wrote it, except two passages which Miss Sullivan read to her to remind her of things she should say in this autobiography, and to show her, when her phrasing troubled her, how much better she did as a little girl.\nFrom the early sketch I take a few passages which seem to me, without making very much allowance for difference in time, almost as good as anything she has written since:\nI discovered the true way to walk when I was a year old, and during the radiant summer days that followed I was never still a minute.\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2026\nThen when my father came in the evening, I would run to the gate to meet him, and he would take me up in his strong arms and put back the tangled curls from my face and kiss me many times, saying, \u201cWhat has my Little Woman been doing today?\u201d\nBut the brightest summer has winter behind it. In the cold, dreary month of February, when I was nineteen months old, I had a serious illness. I still have confused memories of that illness. My mother sat beside my little bed and tried to soothe my feverish moans while in her troubled heart she prayed, \u201cFather in Heaven, spare my baby\u2019s life!\u201d But the fever grew and flamed in my eyes, and for several days my kind physician thought I would die.\nBut early one morning the fever left me as mysteriously and unexpectedly as it had come, and I fell into a quiet sleep. Then my parents knew I would live, and they were very happy. They did not know for some time after my recovery that the cruel fever had taken my sight and hearing; taken all the light and music and gladness out of my little life.\nBut I was too young to realize what had happened. When I awoke and found that all was dark and still, I suppose I thought it was night, and I must have wondered why day was so long coming. Gradually, however, I got used to the silence and darkness that surrounded me, and forgot that it had ever been day.\nI forgot everything that had been except my mother\u2019s tender love. Soon even my childish voice was stilled, because I had ceased to hear any sound.\nBut all was not lost! After all, sight and hearing are but two of the beautiful blessings which God had given me. The most precious, the most wonderful of His gifts was still mine. My mind remained clear and active, \u201cthough fled fore\u2019er the light.\u201d\nAs soon as my strength returned, I began to take an interest in what the people around me were doing. I would cling to my mother\u2019s dress as she went about her household duties, and my little hands felt every object and observed every motion, and in this way I learned a great many things.\nWhen I was a little older I felt the need of some means of communication with those around me, and I began to make simple signs which my parents and friends readily understood; but it often happened that I was unable to express my thoughts intelligibly, and at such times I would give way to my angry feelings utterly.\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2026\nTeacher had been with me nearly two weeks, and I had learned eighteen or twenty words, before that thought flashed into my mind, as the sun breaks upon the sleeping world; and in that moment of illumination the secret of language was revealed to me, and I caught a glimpse of the beautiful country I was about to explore.\nTeacher had been trying all the morning to make me understand that the mug and the milk in the mug had different names; but I was very dull, and kept spelling milk for mug, and mug for milk until teacher must have lost all hope of making me see my mistake. At last she got up, gave me the mug, and led me out of the door to the pump-house. Someone was pumping water, and as the cool fresh stream burst forth, teacher made me put my mug under the spout and spelled \u201cw-a-t-e-r,\u201d Water!\nThat word startled my soul, and it awoke, full of the spirit of the morning, full of joyous, exultant song. Until that day my mind had been like a darkened chamber, waiting for words to enter and light the lamp, which is thought.\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2026\nI learned a great many words that day. I do not remember what they all were; but I do know that mother, father, sister and teacher were among them. It would have been difficult to find a happier little child than I was that night as I lay in my crib and thought over the joy the day had brought me, and for the first time longed for a new day to come.\nThe next morning I awoke with joy in my heart. Everything I touched seemed to quiver with life. It was because I saw everything with the new, strange, beautiful sight which had been given me. I was never angry after that because I understood what my friends said to me, and I was very busy learning many wonderful things. I was never still during the first glad days of my freedom. I was continually spelling and acting out the words as I spelled them. I would run, skip, jump and swing, no matter where I happened to be. Everything was budding and blossoming. The honeysuckle hung in long garlands, deliciously fragrant, and the roses had never been so beautiful before. Teacher and I lived out-of-doors from morning until night, and I rejoiced greatly in the forgotten light and sunshine found again.\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2026\nThe morning after our arrival I awoke bright and early. A beautiful summer day had dawned, the day on which I was to make the acquaintance of a somber and mysterious friend. I got up, and dressed quickly and ran downstairs. I met Teacher in the hall, and begged to be taken to the sea at once. \u201cNot yet,\u201d she responded, laughing. \u201cWe must have breakfast first.\u201d As soon as breakfast was over we hurried off to the shore. Our pathway led through low, sandy hills, and as we hastened on, I often caught my feet in the long, coarse grass, and tumbled, laughing, in the warm, shining sand. The beautiful, warm air was peculiarly fragrant, and I noticed it got cooler and fresher as we went on.\nSuddenly we stopped, and I knew, without being told, the Sea was at my feet. I knew, too, it was immense! awful! and for a moment some of the sunshine seemed to have gone out of the day. But I do not think I was afraid; for later, when I had put on my bathing-suit, and the little waves ran up on the beach and kissed my feet, I shouted for joy, and plunged fearlessly into the surf. But, unfortunately, I struck my foot on a rock and fell forward into the cold water.\nThen a strange, fearful sense of danger terrified me. The salt water filled my eyes, and took away my breath, and a great wave threw me up on the beach as easily as if I had been a little pebble. For several days after that I was very timid, and could hardly be persuaded to go in the water at all; but by degrees my courage returned, and almost before the summer was over, I thought it the greatest fun to be tossed about by the sea-waves.\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2026\nI do not know whether the difference or the similarity in phrasing between the child\u2019s version and the woman\u2019s is the more remarkable. The early story is simpler and shows less deliberate artifice, though even then Miss Keller was prematurely conscious of style, but the art of the later narrative, as in the passage about the sea, or the passage on the medallion of Homer, is surely a fulfilment of the promise of the early story. It was in these early days that Dr.\u00a0Holmes wrote to her: \u201cI am delighted with the style of your letters. There is no affectation about them, and as they come straight from your heart, so they go straight to mine.\u201d\nIn the years when she was growing out of childhood, her style lost its early simplicity and became stiff and, as she says, \u201cperiwigged.\u201d In these years the fear came many times to Miss Sullivan lest the success of the child was to cease with childhood. At times Miss Keller seemed to lack flexibility, her thoughts ran in set phrases which she seemed to have no power to revise or turn over in new ways.\nThen came the work in college\u2060\u2014original theme writing with new ideals of composition or at least new methods of suggesting those ideals. Miss Keller began to get the better of her old friendly taskmaster, the phrase. This book, her first mature experiment in writing, settles the question of her ability to write.\nThe style of the Bible is everywhere in Miss Keller\u2019s work, just as it is in the style of most great English writers. Stevenson, whom Miss Sullivan likes and used to read to her pupil, is another marked influence. In her autobiography are many quotations, chiefly from the Bible and Stevenson, distinct from the context or interwoven with it, the whole a fabric quite of her own design. Her vocabulary has all the phrases that other people use, and the explanation of it, and the reasonableness of it ought to be evident by this time. There is no reason why she should strike from her vocabulary all words of sound and vision. Writing for other people, she should in many cases be true to outer fact rather than to her own experience. So long as she uses words correctly, she should be granted the privilege of using them freely, and not be expected to confine herself to a vocabulary true to her lack of sight and hearing. In her style, as in what she writes about, we must concede to the artist what we deny to the autobiographer. It should be explained, too, that look and see are used by the blind, and hear by the deaf, for perceive; they are simple and more convenient words. Only a literal person could think of holding the blind to perception or apperception, when seeing and looking are so much easier, and have, moreover, in the speech of all men the meaning of intellectual recognition as well as recognition through the sense of sight. When Miss Keller examines a statue, she says in her natural idiom, as her fingers run over the marble, \u201cIt looks like a head of Flora.\u201d\nIt is true, on the other hand, that in her descriptions, she is best from the point of view of art when she is faithful to her own sensations; and this is precisely true of all artists.\nHer recent training has taught her to drop a good deal of her conventionality and to write about experiences in her life which are peculiar to her and which, like the storm in the wild cherry tree, mean most and call for the truest phrasing. She has learned more and more to give up the style she borrowed from books and tried to use, because she wanted to write like other people; she has learned that she is at her best when she \u201cfeels\u201d the lilies sway; lets the roses press into her hands and speaks of the heat which to her means light.\nMiss Keller\u2019s autobiography contains almost everything that she ever intended to publish. It seems worth while, however, to quote from some of her chance bits of writing, which are neither so informal as her letters nor so carefully composed as her story of her life. These extracts are from her exercises in her course in composition, where she showed herself at the beginning of her college life quite without rival among her classmates. Mr.\u00a0Charles T. Copeland, who has been for many years instructor in English and Lecturer on English Literature at Harvard and Radcliffe, said to me: \u201cIn some of her work she has shown that she can write better than any pupil I ever had, man or woman. She has an excellent \u2018ear\u2019 for the flow of sentences.\u201d The extracts follow:\nA few verses of Omar Khayy\u00e1m\u2019s poetry have just been read to me, and I feel as if I had spent the last half-hour in a magnificent sepulcher. Yes, it is a tomb in which hope, joy and the power of acting nobly lie buried. Every beautiful description, every deep thought glides insensibly into the same mournful chant of the brevity of life, of the slow decay and dissolution of all earthly things. The poet\u2019s bright, fond memories of love, youth and beauty are but the funeral torches shedding their light on this tomb, or to modify the image a little, they are the flowers that bloom on it, watered with tears and fed by a bleeding heart. Beside the tomb sits a weary soul, rejoicing neither in the joys of the past nor in the possibilities of the future, but seeking consolation in forgetfulness. In vain the inspiring sea shouts to this languid soul, in vain the heavens strive with its weakness; it still persists in regretting and seeks a refuge in oblivion from the pangs of present woe. At times it catches some faint echo from the living, joyous, real world, a gleam of the perfection that is to be; and, thrilled out of its despondency, feels capable of working out a grand ideal even \u201cin the poor, miserable, hampered actual,\u201d wherein it is placed; but in a moment the inspiration, the vision is gone, and this great, much-suffering soul is again enveloped in the darkness of uncertainty and despair.\nIt is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.\nI often think that beautiful ideas embarrass most people as much as the company of great men. They are regarded generally as far more appropriate in books and in public discourses than in the parlor or at the table. Of course I do not refer to beautiful sentiments, but to the higher truths relating to everyday life. Few people that I know seem ever to pause in their daily intercourse to wonder at the beautiful bits of truth they have gathered during their years of study. Often when I speak enthusiastically of something in history or in poetry, I receive no response, and I feel that I must change the subject and return to the commonest topics, such as the weather, dressmaking, sports, sickness, \u201cblues\u201d and \u201cworries.\u201d To be sure, I take the keenest interest in everything that concerns those who surround me; it is this very interest which makes it so difficult for me to carry on a conversation with some people who will not talk or say what they think, but I should not be sorry to find more friends ready to talk with me now and then about the wonderful things I read. We need not be like Les Femmes Savantes but we ought to have something to say about what we learn as well as about what we must do, and what our professors say or how they mark our themes.\nToday I took luncheon with the Freshman Class of Radcliffe. This was my first real experience in college life, and a delightful experience it was! For the first time since my entrance into Radcliffe I had the opportunity to make friends with all my classmates, and the pleasure of knowing that they regarded me as one of themselves, instead of thinking of me as living apart and taking no interest in the everyday nothings of their life, as I had sometimes feared they did. I have often been surprised to hear this opinion expressed or rather implied by girls of my own age and even by people advanced in years. Once someone wrote to me that in his mind I was always \u201csweet and earnest,\u201d thinking only of what is wise, good and interesting\u2060\u2014as if he thought I was one of those wearisome saints of whom there are only too many in the world! I always laugh at these foolish notions, and assure my friends that it is much better to have a few faults and be cheerful and responsive in spite of all deprivations than to retire into one\u2019s shell, pet one\u2019s affliction, clothe it with sanctity, and then set one\u2019s self up as a monument of patience, virtue, goodness and all in all; but even while I laugh I feel a twinge of pain in my heart, because it seems rather hard to me that anyone should imagine that I do not feel the tender bonds which draw me to my young sisters\u2060\u2014the sympathies springing from what we have in common\u2060\u2014youth, hope, a half-eager, half-timid attitude towards the life before us and above all the royalty of maidenhood.\nSainte-Beuve says, \u201cIl vient un age peut-\u00eatre quand on n\u2019ecrit plus.\u201d This is the only allusion I have read to the possibility that the sources of literature, varied and infinite as they seem now, may sometime be exhausted. It surprises me to find that such an idea has crossed the mind of anyone, especially of a highly gifted critic. The very fact that the nineteenth century has not produced many authors whom the world may count among the greatest of all time does not in my opinion justify the remark, \u201cThere may come a time when people cease to write.\u201d\nIn the first place, the fountains of literature are fed by two vast worlds, one of action, one of thought, by a succession of creations in the one and of changes in the other. New experiences and events call forth new ideas and stir men to ask questions unthought of before, and seek a definite answer in the depths of human knowledge.\nIn the second place, if it is true that as many centuries must pass before the world becomes perfect as passed before it became what it is today, literature will surely be enriched incalculably by the tremendous changes, acquisitions and improvements that cannot fail to take place in the distant future. If genius has been silent for a century it has not been idle. On the contrary, it has been collecting fresh materials not only from the remote past, but also from the age of progress and development, and perhaps in the new century there will be outbursts of splendor in all the various branches of literature. At present the world is undergoing a complete revolution, and in the midst of falling systems and empires, conflicting theories and creeds, discoveries and inventions, it is a marvel how one can produce any great literary works at all. This is an age of workers, not of thinkers. The song today is:\n\nLet the dead past bury its dead,\n\nAct, act in the living present,\n\nHeart within and God overhead.\n\nA little later, when the rush and heat of achievement relax, we can begin to expect the appearance of grand men to celebrate in glorious poetry and prose the deeds and triumphs of the last few centuries.\nIt is very interesting to watch a plant grow, it is like taking part in creation. When all outside is cold and white, when the little children of the woodland are gone to their nurseries in the warm earth, and the empty nests on the bare trees fill with snow, my window-garden glows and smiles, making summer within while it is winter without. It is wonderful to see flowers bloom in the midst of a snowstorm! I have felt a bud \u201cshyly doff her green hood and blossom with a silken burst of sound,\u201d while the icy fingers of the snow beat against the windowpanes. What secret power, I wonder, caused this blossoming miracle? What mysterious force guided the seedling from the dark earth up to the light, through leaf and stem and bud, to glorious fulfilment in the perfect flower? Who could have dreamed that such beauty lurked in the dark earth, was latent in the tiny seed we planted? Beautiful flower, you have taught me to see a little way into the hidden heart of things. Now I understand that the darkness everywhere may hold possibilities better even than my hopes.\nA Free Translation from Horace\nBook II\u221218.\nI am not one of those on whom fortune deigns to smile. My house is not resplendent with ivory and gold; nor is it adorned with marble arches, resting on graceful columns brought from the quarries of distant Africa. For me no thrifty spinners weave purple garments. I have not unexpectedly fallen heir to princely estates, titles or power; but I have something more to be desired than all the world\u2019s treasures\u2060\u2014the love of my friends, and honorable fame, won by my own industry and talents. Despite my poverty, it is my privilege to be the companion of the rich and mighty. I am too grateful for all these blessings to wish for more from princes, or from the gods. My little Sabine farm is dear to me; for here I spend my happiest days, far from the noise and strife of the world.\nO, ye who live in the midst of luxury, who seek beautiful marbles for new villas, that shall surpass the old in splendor, you never dream that the shadow of death is hanging over your halls. Forgetful of the tomb, you lay the foundation of your palaces. In your mad pursuit of pleasure you rob the sea of its beach and desecrate hallowed ground. More even than this, in your wickedness you destroy the peaceful homes of your clients! Without a touch of remorse you drive the father from his land, clasping to his bosom his household gods and his half-naked children.\nYou forget that death comes to the rich and the poor alike, and comes once for all; but remember, Acheron could not be bribed by gold to ferry the crafty Prometheus back to the sunlit world. Tantalus, too, great as he was above all mortals, went down to the kingdom of the dead, never to return. Remember, too, that, although death is inexorable, yet he is just; for he brings retribution to the rich for their wickedness, and gives the poor eternal rest from their toil and sorrow.\nAh, the pranks that the nixies of Dreamland play on us while we sleep! Methinks \u201cthey are jesters at the Court of Heaven.\u201d They frequently take the shape of daily themes to mock me; they strut about on the stage of Sleep like foolish virgins, only they carry well-trimmed notebooks in their hands instead of empty lamps. At other times they examine and cross-examine me in all the studies I have ever had, and invariably ask me questions as easy to answer as this: \u201cWhat was the name of the first mouse that worried Hippopotamus, satrap of Cambridge under Astyagas, grandfather of Cyrus the Great?\u201d I wake terror-stricken with the words ringing in my ears, \u201cAn answer or your life!\u201d\nSuch are the distorted fancies that flit through the mind of one who is at college and lives as I do in an atmosphere of ideas, conceptions and half-thoughts, half-feelings which tumble and jostle each other until one is almost crazy. I rarely have dreams that are not in keeping with what I really think and feel, but one night my very nature seemed to change, and I stood in the eye of the world a mighty man and a terrible. Naturally I love peace and hate war and all that pertains to war; I see nothing admirable in the ruthless career of Napoleon, save its finish. Nevertheless, in that dream the spirit of that pitiless slayer of men entered me! I shall never forget how the fury of battle throbbed in my veins\u2060\u2014it seemed as if the tumultuous beating of my heart would stop my breath. I rode a fiery hunter\u2060\u2014I can feel the impatient toss of his head now and the quiver that ran through him at the first roar of the cannon.\nFrom the top of the hill where I stood I saw my army surging over a sunlit plain like angry breakers, and as they moved, I saw the green of fields, like the cool hollows between billows. Trumpet answered trumpet above the steady beat of drums and the rhythm of marching feet. I spurred my panting steed and waving my sword on high and shouting, \u201cI come! Behold me, warriors\u2060\u2014Europe!\u201d I plunged into the oncoming billows, as a strong swimmer dives into breakers, and struck, alas, \u2019tis true, the bedpost!\nNow I rarely sleep without dreaming; but before Miss Sullivan came to me, my dreams were few and far between, devoid of thought or coherency, except those of a purely physical nature. In my dreams something was always falling suddenly and heavily, and at times my nurse seemed to punish me for my unkind treatment of her in the daytime and return at an usurer\u2019s rate of interest my kickings and pinchings. I would wake with a start or struggle frantically to escape from my tormentor. I was very fond of bananas, and one night I dreamed that I found a long string of them in the dining-room, near the cupboard, all peeled and deliciously ripe, and all I had to do was to stand under the string and eat as long as I could eat.\nAfter Miss Sullivan came to me, the more I learned, the oftener I dreamed; but with the waking of my mind there came many dreary fancies and vague terrors which troubled my sleep for a long time. I dreaded the darkness and loved the woodfire. Its warm touch seemed so like a human caress, I really thought it was a sentient being, capable of loving and protecting me. One cold winter night I was alone in my room. Miss Sullivan had put out the light and gone away, thinking I was sound asleep. Suddenly I felt my bed shake, and a wolf seemed to spring on me and snarl in my face. It was only a dream, but I thought it real, and my heart sank within me. I dared not scream, and I dared not stay in bed. Perhaps this was a confused recollection of the story I had heard not long before about Red Riding Hood. At all events, I slipped down from the bed and nestled close to the fire which had not flickered out. The instant I felt its warmth I was reassured, and I sat a long time watching it climb higher and higher in shining waves. At last sleep surprised me, and when Miss Sullivan returned she found me wrapped in a blanket by the hearth.\nOften when I dream, thoughts pass through my mind like cowled shadows, silent and remote, and disappear. Perhaps they are the ghosts of thoughts that once inhabited the mind of an ancestor. At other times the things I have learned and the things I have been taught, drop away, as the lizard sheds its skin, and I see my soul as God sees it. There are also rare and beautiful moments when I see and hear in Dreamland. What if in my waking hours a sound should ring through the silent halls of hearing? What if a ray of light should flash through the darkened chambers of my soul? What would happen, I ask many and many a time. Would the bow-and-string tension of life snap? Would the heart, overweighted with sudden joy, stop beating for very excess of happiness?\n", "summary": "\nThe text begins with \"The Frost King,\" a story about King Frost who lives in a beautiful ice palace in the far North. The narrative describes how King Frost decided to send his treasures to Santa Claus, entrusting his fairy servants to deliver them. The mischievous fairies, however, hid the treasures among tree leaves while taking a break to play. King Sun discovered the hidden treasures and melted them, causing the precious stones to run down the trees, turning their leaves to brilliant autumn colors. When King Frost discovered what happened, he was initially angry but became pleased upon seeing children delighting in the colorful leaves. Since then, King Frost has made it his duty to paint autumn leaves with glowing colors.\nThis story became the center of a significant controversy in Helen Keller's early life. In 1892, when Helen was eleven years old, she sent a story called \"The Frost King\" as a birthday gift to Mr. Anagnos, the director of the Perkins Institution for the Blind. It was later discovered that Helen's story closely resembled \"Frost Fairies\" by Margaret Canby, raising questions about whether Helen had plagiarized the work. This incident deeply troubled Helen, who insisted she had never heard the story before and believed she had written it herself. As recorded in her diary entry of January 30, 1892, she was heartbroken that people thought she had been \"untrue and wicked,\" stating that she loved \"the beautiful truth\" with her whole heart.\nAn extensive investigation followed to determine how this apparent act of plagiarism could have occurred. Mr. Anagnos, who initially published Helen's story, was troubled by the accusations but remained supportive. Captain Keller, Helen's father, confirmed that none of her relatives or friends at home could have shared the story with her. The only possible explanation emerged when it was discovered that Mrs. Hopkins might have read Canby's story to Helen during a visit in the summer of 1888, when Helen was still in the early stages of her education and had limited language skills. The investigation concluded that Helen had likely heard the story once, three years before she wrote her version, and had retained it in her memory without conscious recollection of its source.\nThe episode had a profound impact on both Helen and her teacher, Annie Sullivan. Miss Sullivan feared she had allowed Helen's habit of imitation to go too far, potentially limiting her genuine creative abilities. The incident revealed something remarkable about Helen's mind: her ability to store words and stories even when she didn't fully understand them at the time, and how these could later emerge in her own writing. Unlike most children whose memories become confused by multiple inputs, Helen's isolation due to her disabilities meant that stories remained distinct in her mind, although they did take on aspects of her own temperament and vocabulary when reproduced.\nThe text analyzes how this incident illuminates questions about language and style. It suggests that all use of language is imitative, and one's style develops from exposure to other styles. For Helen Keller, this was especially true as she had been \"nurtured on imaginative literature\" and had gathered into her \"vigorous and tenacious memory the style of great writers.\" Her early education exposed her only to good literature, and this shaped her writing style. The text notes that Helen's version of \"The Frost King\" had elements of superior imagination, such as the phrase \"twelve soldierly-looking white bears,\" which showed a genuine creative quality despite its borrowed foundation.\nAs Helen matured as a writer, her style evolved from the simple, unaffected writing of childhood to a period of stiffness she herself described as \"periwigged.\" Her college education brought new ideals of composition, helping her overcome her reliance on set phrases. The Bible and Robert Louis Stevenson are cited as significant influences on her writing style. The text argues that Helen should not be expected to strike from her vocabulary words related to sight and sound, as these are part of common language even for those who cannot see or hear. Terms like \"look\" and \"see\" are used by blind people to mean \"perceive,\" and restricting Helen's vocabulary to only what she could directly experience would unnecessarily limit her expression.\nThe text contains numerous examples of Helen's writing that demonstrate her talent. In an early sketch recounting her childhood, she vividly describes discovering water: \"That word startled my soul, and it awoke, full of the spirit of the morning, full of joyous, exultant song. Until that day my mind had been like a darkened chamber, waiting for words to enter and light the lamp, which is thought.\" Her instructor at Harvard and Radcliffe, Charles T. Copeland, declared that \"she can write better than any pupil I ever had, man or woman\" and praised her excellent \"ear\" for the flow of sentences.\nExamples of Helen's mature writing include her reflections on Omar Khayy\u00e1m's poetry, where she writes that it feels like spending time \"in a magnificent sepulcher\" where \"hope, joy and the power of acting nobly lie buried.\" She also ponders why people spend so much time \"fighting the devil\" when they could expend that energy \"loving their fellow men,\" and observes that \"beautiful ideas embarrass most people as much as the company of great men.\" Her writing demonstrates both philosophical depth and lyrical beauty, as in her description of flowers blooming during winter: \"I have felt a bud 'shyly doff her green hood and blossom with a silken burst of sound,' while the icy fingers of the snow beat against the windowpanes.\"\nThe text concludes with Helen's reflections on dreams, describing how her dreams evolved from simple physical sensations before Miss Sullivan's arrival to complex narratives afterward. She writes of how sometimes in dreams, \"the things I have learned and the things I have been taught, drop away, as the lizard sheds its skin, and I see my soul as God sees it.\" She wonders what would happen if in her waking hours, a sound should ring through the \"silent halls of hearing\" or a ray of light flash through her \"darkened chambers,\" asking if the \"bow-and-string tension of life\" would snap or if her heart would \"stop beating for very excess of happiness.\"\nThe controversy around \"The Frost King\" ultimately revealed important truths about language acquisition, memory, and the creative process. Far from diminishing Helen Keller's achievements, it illuminated the remarkable workings of her mind and her extraordinary relationship with language. Despite being unable to see or hear, Helen developed into a writer of unusual sensitivity and power, demonstrating that the limitations of the senses need not limit the imagination or expression. Her writing stands as testimony to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of education and language.\n", "map": [["King Frost", "Ice Palace"], ["King Frost", "Autumn Leaves"], ["Fairy Servants", "Hidden Treasures"], ["King Sun", "Melted Treasures"], ["Melted Treasures", "Colorful Leaves"], ["The Frost King", "Helen Keller"], ["The Frost King", "Plagiarism Controversy"], ["Helen Keller", "Mr. Anagnos"], ["Mr. Anagnos", "Perkins Institution"], ["The Frost King", "Frost Fairies"], ["Frost Fairies", "Margaret Canby"], ["Helen Keller", "Unconscious Memory"], ["Mrs. Hopkins", "Margaret Canby's Story"], ["Helen Keller", "Annie Sullivan"], ["Plagiarism Controversy", "Investigation"], ["Investigation", "Memory Retention"], ["Helen Keller", "Language Acquisition"], ["Isolation", "Distinct Memories"], ["Language", "Imitation"], ["Helen Keller", "Writing Evolution"], ["Writing Evolution", "College Education"], ["Helen Keller", "Bible Influence"], ["Helen Keller", "Stevenson Influence"], ["Vision Vocabulary", "Common Language"], ["Helen Keller", "Writing Talent"], ["Writing Talent", "Charles Copeland"], ["Helen Keller", "Philosophical Reflections"], ["Helen Keller", "Nature Descriptions"], ["Helen Keller", "Dream Evolution"], ["Sensory Limitations", "Expressive Power"], ["Controversy", "Language Insights"], ["Helen Keller", "Human Resilience"], ["Education", "Transformation"]]}
