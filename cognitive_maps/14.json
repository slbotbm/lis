His gentleness\r\nwas never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of\r\nfrankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand\r\nways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\r\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first\r\nfluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so\r\nardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning\r\nwhilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\r\n\n\r\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.\r\nMy ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that\r\nof the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how\r\nCornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt\r\nexultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid\r\nno visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some\r\ndiscoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can\r\nconceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\r\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a\r\nscientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of\r\nmoderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at\r\ngreat proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment\r\nof one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly\r\nthat at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some\r\nchemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\r\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted\r\nwith the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons\r\nof any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer\r\nconducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my\r\nnative town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.\r\n\n\r\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the\r\nstructure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence,\r\nI often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold\r\nquestion, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how\r\nmany things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or\r\ncarelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in\r\nmy mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those\r\nbranches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\r\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study\r\nwould have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life,\r\nwe must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of\r\nanatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and\r\ncorruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest\r\nprecautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do\r\nnot ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\r\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a\r\nchurchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which,\r\nfrom being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I\r\nwas led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend\r\ndays and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every\r\nobject the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how\r\nthe fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death\r\nsucceed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders\r\nof the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of\r\ncausation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life,\r\nuntil from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me\u2014a light\r\nso brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the\r\nimmensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\r\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science,\r\nthat I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.\r\n\n\r\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more\r\ncertainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Some\r\nmiracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct\r\nand probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I\r\nsucceeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became\r\nmyself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.\r\n\n\r\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave\r\nplace to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to\r\narrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation\r\nof my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the\r\nsteps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I\r\nbeheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men\r\nsince the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic\r\nscene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\r\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards\r\nthe object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was\r\nlike the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life,\r\naided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.\r\n\n\r\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my\r\nfriend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am\r\nacquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you\r\nwill easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you\r\non, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible\r\nmisery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how\r\ndangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who\r\nbelieves his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater\r\nthan his nature will allow.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long\r\ntime concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed\r\nthe capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception\r\nof it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a\r\nwork of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I\r\nshould attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler\r\norganization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to\r\npermit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and\r\nwonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\r\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\r\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\r\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet\r\nwhen I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and\r\nmechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the\r\nfoundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and\r\ncomplexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with\r\nthese feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of\r\nthe parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my\r\nfirst intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about\r\neight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this\r\ndetermination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and\r\narranging my materials, I began.\r\n\n\r\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a\r\nhurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me\r\nideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light\r\ninto our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source;\r\nmany happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could\r\nclaim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.\r\nPursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon\r\nlifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it\r\nimpossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to\r\ncorruption.\r\n\n\r\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with\r\nunremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had\r\nbecome emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I\r\nfailed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might\r\nrealise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had\r\ndedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with\r\nunrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who\r\nshall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed\r\ndamps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?\r\nMy limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a\r\nresistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost\r\nall soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing\r\ntrance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural\r\nstimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones\r\nfrom charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets\r\nof the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the\r\nhouse, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\r\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their\r\nsockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and\r\nthe slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human\r\nnature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an\r\neagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.\r\n\n\r\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one\r\npursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more\r\nplentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were\r\ninsensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect\r\nthe scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many\r\nmiles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence\r\ndisquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: \u201cI know that\r\nwhile you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we\r\nshall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption\r\nin your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally\r\nneglected.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI knew well therefore what would be my father\u2019s feelings, but I could not tear\r\nmy thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an\r\nirresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all\r\nthat related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which\r\nswallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.\r\n\n\r\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice\r\nor faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in\r\nconceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in\r\nperfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow\r\npassion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that\r\nthe pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which\r\nyou apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your\r\ntaste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\r\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If\r\nthis rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to\r\ninterfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been\r\nenslaved, C\u00e6sar would have spared his country, America would have been\r\ndiscovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\n\r\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and\r\nyour looks remind me to proceed.\r\n\n\r\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by\r\ninquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring,\r\nand summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or\r\nthe expanding leaves\u2014sights which before always yielded me supreme delight\u2014so\r\ndeeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered\r\nbefore my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly\r\nhow well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I\r\nappeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\r\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every\r\nnight I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful\r\ndegree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if\r\nI had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived\r\nthat I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours\r\nwould soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive\r\naway incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation\r\nshould be complete.\r\n\n\r\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my\r\ntoils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the\r\ninstruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the\r\nlifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain\r\npattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when,\r\nby the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the\r\ncreature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\r\n\n\r\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch\r\nwhom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs\r\nwere in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!\r\nGreat God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries\r\nbeneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly\r\nwhiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his\r\nwatery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in\r\nwhich they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\r\n\n\r\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human\r\nnature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of\r\ninfusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest\r\nand health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but\r\nnow that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless\r\nhorror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I\r\nhad created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\r\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded\r\nto the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my\r\nclothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in\r\nvain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I\r\nsaw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.\r\nDelighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on\r\nher lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to\r\nchange, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a\r\nshroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of\r\nthe flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my\r\nforehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim\r\nand yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters,\r\nI beheld the wretch\u2014the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the\r\ncurtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.\r\nHis jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin\r\nwrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was\r\nstretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I\r\ntook refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I\r\nremained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\r\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were\r\nto announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably\r\ngiven life.\r\n\n\r\nOh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again\r\nendued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on\r\nhim while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were\r\nrendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have\r\nconceived.\r\n\n\r\nI passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly\r\nthat I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the\r\nground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt\r\nthe bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant\r\nrest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so\r\nrapid, the overthrow so complete!\r\n\n\r\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and\r\naching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which\r\nindicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had\r\nthat night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with\r\nquick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of\r\nthe street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment\r\nwhich I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain\r\nwhich poured from a black and comfortless sky.\r\n\n\r\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily\r\nexercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets\r\nwithout any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart\r\npalpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not\r\ndaring to look about me:\r\n\n\r\nLike one who, on a lonely road,\r\nDoth walk in fear and dread,\r\nAnd, having once turned round, walks on,\r\nAnd turns no more his head;\r\nBecause he knows a frightful fiend\r\nDoth close behind him tread.\n\r\n[Coleridge\u2019s \u201cAncient Mariner.\u201d]\r\n\n\r\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\r\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I\r\nremained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me\r\nfrom the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the\r\nSwiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being\r\nopened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. \u201cMy\r\ndear Frankenstein,\u201d exclaimed he, \u201chow glad I am to see you! How fortunate that\r\nyou should be here at the very moment of my alighting!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to\r\nmy thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my\r\nrecollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and\r\nmisfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm\r\nand serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner,\r\nand we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about\r\nour mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to\r\nIngolstadt. \u201cYou may easily believe,\u201d said he, \u201chow great was the difficulty to\r\npersuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble\r\nart of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last,\r\nfor his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the\r\nDutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: \u2018I have ten thousand florins a\r\nyear without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.\u2019 But his affection for me at\r\nlength overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a\r\nvoyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my\r\nfather, brothers, and Elizabeth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so\r\nseldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.\r\nBut, my dear Frankenstein,\u201d continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my\r\nface, \u201cI did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you\r\nlook as if you had been watching for several nights.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation\r\nthat I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I\r\nsincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at\r\nlength free.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude\r\nto, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we\r\nsoon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver,\r\nthat the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive\r\nand walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more\r\nthat Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes\r\nat the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was\r\nalready on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and\r\na cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are\r\naccustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the\r\nother side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was\r\nempty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly\r\nbelieve that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became\r\nassured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down\r\nto Clerval.\r\n\n\r\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I\r\nwas unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my\r\nflesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was\r\nunable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the\r\nchairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my\r\nunusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more\r\nattentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and\r\nmy loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Victor,\u201d cried he, \u201cwhat, for God\u2019s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh\r\nin that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo not ask me,\u201d cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw\r\nthe dreaded spectre glide into the room; \u201che can tell. Oh, save me! Save\r\nme!\u201d I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down\r\nin a fit.\r\n\n\r\nPoor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated\r\nwith such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of\r\nhis grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long\r\ntime.\r\n\n\r\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several\r\nmonths. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned\r\nthat, knowing my father\u2019s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and\r\nhow wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by\r\nconcealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind\r\nand attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery,\r\nhe did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action\r\nthat he could towards them.\r\n\n\r\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\r\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of\r\nthe monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I\r\nraved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at\r\nfirst believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the\r\npertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him\r\nthat my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\r\n\n\r\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my\r\nfriend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing\r\noutward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves\r\nhad disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that\r\nshaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to\r\nmy convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my\r\nbosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before\r\nI was attacked by the fatal passion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDearest Clerval,\u201d exclaimed I, \u201chow kind, how very good you are to me. This\r\nwhole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has\r\nbeen consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest\r\nremorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will\r\nforgive me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as\r\nfast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you\r\non one subject, may I not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom\r\nI dared not even think?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCompose yourself,\u201d said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, \u201cI will not\r\nmention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy\r\nif they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know\r\nhow ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would\r\nnot fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving\r\nof my love?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a\r\nletter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I\r\nbelieve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own\r\nElizabeth:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dearest Cousin,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry\r\nare not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to\r\nwrite\u2014to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm\r\nour apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring\r\nthis line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a\r\njourney to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and\r\nperhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being\r\nable to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\r\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess\r\nyour wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor\r\ncousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting\r\nbetter. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGet well\u2014and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends\r\nwho love you dearly. Your father\u2019s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see\r\nyou, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his\r\nbenevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of\r\nour Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous\r\nto be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with\r\nhim, at least until his elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased\r\nwith the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had\r\nyour powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time\r\nis spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that\r\nhe will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on\r\nthe profession which he has selected.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLittle alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place\r\nsince you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains\u2014they never change; and\r\nI think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same\r\nimmutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am\r\nrewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.\r\nSince you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. Do\r\nyou remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you\r\ndo not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her\r\nmother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This\r\ngirl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange\r\nperversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz,\r\ntreated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years\r\nof age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The\r\nrepublican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier\r\nmanners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.\r\nHence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants;\r\nand the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\r\nmore refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a\r\nservant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned\r\nthe duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not\r\ninclude the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you\r\nonce remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could\r\ndissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of\r\nAngelica\u2014she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great\r\nattachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior\r\nto that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine\r\nwas the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made\r\nany professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes\r\nthat she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in\r\nmany respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every\r\ngesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured\r\nto imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me\r\nof her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief\r\nto notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most\r\nanxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved\r\nfor her.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception\r\nof her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was\r\ntroubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement\r\nfrom heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe\r\nher confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few\r\nmonths after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\r\nrepentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much\r\naltered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning\r\nmildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was\r\nher residence at her mother\u2019s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor\r\nwoman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to\r\nforgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the\r\ndeaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame\r\nMoritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\r\nnow at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the\r\nbeginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure\r\nyou I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty;\r\nas I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my\r\ndear aunt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.\r\nI wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue\r\neyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples\r\nappear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two\r\nlittle wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of\r\nfive years of age.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip\r\nconcerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already\r\nreceived the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young\r\nEnglishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard,\r\nthe rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has\r\nsuffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he\r\nhas already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of\r\nmarrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and\r\nmuch older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\r\neverybody.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns\r\nupon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,\u2014one line\u2014one word will be a\r\nblessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection,\r\nand his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of\r\nyourself; and, I entreat you, write!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElizabeth Lavenza.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGeneva, March 18th, 17\u2014.\u201d\n\n\r\n\u201cDear, dear Elizabeth!\u201d I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: \u201cI will write\r\ninstantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.\u201d I wrote, and this\r\nexertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded\r\nregularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\r\n\n\r\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several\r\nprofessors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage,\r\nill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal\r\nnight, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had\r\nconceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I\r\nwas otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument\r\nwould renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had\r\nremoved all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\r\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been\r\nmy laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited\r\nthe professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and\r\nwarmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived\r\nthat I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my\r\nfeelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the\r\nscience itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\r\ncould I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed\r\ncarefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards\r\nused in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet\r\ndared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always\r\nquick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging,\r\nin excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.\r\nI thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he\r\nwas surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I\r\nloved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I\r\ncould never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often\r\npresent to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only\r\nimpress more deeply.\r\n\n\r\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost\r\ninsupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain\r\nthan the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. \u201cD\u2014n the fellow!\u201d cried he;\r\n\u201cwhy, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you\r\nplease; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago,\r\nbelieved in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself\r\nat the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all\r\nbe out of countenance.\u2014Ay, ay,\u201d continued he, observing my face expressive of\r\nsuffering, \u201cM. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\r\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself\r\nwhen young; but that wears out in a very short time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the\r\nconversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\r\n\n\r\nClerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\r\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to\r\nthe university with the design of making himself complete master of the\r\noriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had\r\nmarked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his\r\neyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The\r\nPersian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily\r\ninduced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and\r\nnow that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\r\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only\r\ninstruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like\r\nhim, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate\r\nmaking any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to\r\nunderstand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is\r\nsoothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying\r\nthe authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\r\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,\u2014in the smiles and frowns of a fair\r\nenemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly\r\nand heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\r\n\n\r\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for\r\nthe latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and\r\nsnow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded\r\nuntil the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see\r\nmy native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long,\r\nfrom an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\r\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\r\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its\r\nbeauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\r\n\n\r\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which\r\nwas to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in\r\nthe environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country\r\nI had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was\r\nfond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the\r\nramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\r\n\n\r\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long\r\nbeen restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I\r\nbreathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my\r\nfriend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my\r\nfellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better\r\nfeelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the\r\ncheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me,\r\nand endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A\r\nselfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\r\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a\r\nfew years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy,\r\ninanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful\r\nsensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present\r\nseason was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while\r\nthose of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during\r\nthe preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw\r\nthem off, with an invincible burden.\r\n\n\r\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\r\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his\r\nsoul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his\r\nconversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the\r\nPersian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.\r\nAt other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments,\r\nwhich he supported with great ingenuity.\r\n\n\r\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing,\r\nand every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I\r\nbounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\r\n\n\r\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Victor,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your\r\nreturn to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely\r\nmentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel\r\nkindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you\r\nexpected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and\r\nwretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have\r\nrendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my\r\nlong absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\r\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are\r\nto convey to you the horrible tidings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWilliam is dead!\u2014that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart,\r\nwho was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of\r\nthe transaction.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLast Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in\r\nPlainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther\r\nthan usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we\r\ndiscovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be\r\nfound. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently\r\nErnest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been\r\nplaying with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly\r\nsought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not\r\nreturn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night\r\nfell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He\r\nwas not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I\r\nthought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps\r\nand dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the\r\nmorning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming\r\nand active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of\r\nthe murder\u2019s finger was on his neck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance\r\nbetrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At\r\nfirst I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where\r\nit lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands\r\nexclaimed, \u2018O God! I have murdered my darling child!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived,\r\nit was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had\r\nteased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your\r\nmother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the\r\nmurderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our\r\nexertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved\r\nWilliam!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually,\r\nand accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my\r\nheart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you,\r\nmy son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now\r\nsay, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her\r\nyoungest darling!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but\r\nwith feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering,\r\nthe wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with\r\nkindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your\r\nenemies.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour affectionate and afflicted father,\r\n\u201cAlphonse Frankenstein.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGeneva, May 12th, 17\u2014.\u201d\n\n\r\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to\r\nobserve the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving\r\nnews from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with\r\nmy hands.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Frankenstein,\u201d exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with\r\nbitterness, \u201care you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in\r\nthe extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read\r\nthe account of my misfortune.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can offer you no consolation, my friend,\u201d said he; \u201cyour disaster is\r\nirreparable. What do you intend to do?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he\r\ncould only express his heartfelt sympathy. \u201cPoor William!\u201d said he, \u201cdear\r\nlovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright\r\nand joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so\r\nmiserably; to feel the murderer\u2019s grasp! How much more a murdered that could\r\ndestroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we;\r\nhis friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings\r\nare at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He\r\ncan no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\r\nsurvivors.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed\r\nthemselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as\r\nsoon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my\r\nfriend.\r\n\n\r\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to\r\nconsole and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew\r\nnear my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the\r\nmultitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes\r\nfamiliar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How\r\naltered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change\r\nhad taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees\r\nworked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might\r\nnot be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a\r\nthousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define\r\nthem.\r\n\n\r\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated\r\nthe lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains,\r\n\u201cthe palaces of nature,\u201d were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly\r\nscene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.\r\n\n\r\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my\r\nnative town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the\r\nbright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. \u201cDear mountains! my own\r\nbeautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the\r\nsky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at\r\nmy unhappiness?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these\r\npreliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I\r\nthink of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native\r\ncan tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and,\r\nmore than all, thy lovely lake!\r\n\n\r\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed\r\naround; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more\r\ngloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw\r\nobscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.\r\nAlas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in\r\nall the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of\r\nthe anguish I was destined to endure.\r\n\n\r\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of\r\nthe town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a\r\nvillage at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene;\r\nand, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor\r\nWilliam had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged\r\nto cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage\r\nI saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful\r\nfigures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a\r\nlow hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were\r\nclouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its\r\nviolence quickly increased.\r\n\n\r\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased\r\nevery minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was\r\nechoed from Sal\u00eave, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of\r\nlightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast\r\nsheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness,\r\nuntil the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often\r\nthe case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\r\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake\r\nwhich lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Cop\u00eat. Another\r\nstorm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes\r\ndisclosed the M\u00f4le, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.\r\n\n\r\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a\r\nhasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands,\r\nand exclaimed aloud, \u201cWilliam, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy\r\ndirge!\u201d As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole\r\nfrom behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could\r\nnot be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered\r\nits shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect\r\nmore hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the\r\nwretch, the filthy d\u00e6mon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he\r\nbe (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did\r\nthat idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\r\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\r\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\r\nhave destroyed the fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt\r\nit. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I\r\nthought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another\r\nflash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular\r\nascent of Mont Sal\u00eave, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon\r\nreached the summit, and disappeared.\r\n\n\r\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and\r\nthe scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the\r\nevents which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress\r\ntoward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside;\r\nits departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he\r\nfirst received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose\r\ninto the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had\r\nhe not murdered my brother?\r\n\n\r\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night,\r\nwhich I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the\r\ninconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and\r\ndespair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with\r\nthe will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had\r\nnow done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from\r\nthe grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\r\n\n\r\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and\r\nI hastened to my father\u2019s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew\r\nof the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I\r\nreflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed,\r\nand endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an\r\ninaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had\r\nbeen seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an\r\nair of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if\r\nany other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it\r\nas the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would\r\nelude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives\r\nto commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a\r\ncreature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Sal\u00eave? These\r\nreflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.\r\n\n\r\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father\u2019s house. I told the\r\nservants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their\r\nusual hour of rising.\r\n\n\r\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\r\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure\r\nfor Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed\r\non the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an\r\nhistorical subject, painted at my father\u2019s desire, and represented Caroline\r\nBeaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her\r\ngarb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and\r\nbeauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a\r\nminiature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was\r\nthus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome\r\nme: \u201cWelcome, my dearest Victor,\u201d said he. \u201cAh! I wish you had come three\r\nmonths ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come\r\nto us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence\r\nwill, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and\r\nyour persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting\r\nself-accusations.\u2014Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother\u2019s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept\r\nover my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated\r\nhome; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I\r\ntried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I\r\nnamed my cousin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe most of all,\u201d said Ernest, \u201crequires consolation; she accused herself of\r\nhaving caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But\r\nsince the murderer has been discovered\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to\r\npursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or\r\nconfine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do not know what you mean,\u201d replied my brother, in accents of wonder, \u201cbut\r\nto us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it\r\nat first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the\r\nevidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and\r\nfond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so\r\nappalling a crime?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJustine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully;\r\nevery one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost\r\nforced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to\r\nadd to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.\r\nBut she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been\r\ndiscovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several\r\ndays. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the\r\napparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket\r\nthe picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the\r\nmurderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without\r\nsaying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their\r\ndeposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor\r\ngirl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\r\nmanner.\r\n\n\r\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\r\nearnestly, \u201cYou are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good\r\nJustine, is innocent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his\r\ncountenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had\r\nexchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than\r\nthat of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, \u201cGood God, papa! Victor says\r\nthat he knows who was the murderer of poor William.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe do also, unfortunately,\u201d replied my father, \u201cfor indeed I had rather have\r\nbeen for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude\r\nin one I valued so highly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried\r\ntoday, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and\r\nindeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear,\r\ntherefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong\r\nenough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding\r\nhorror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist,\r\nexcept I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in\r\nthe existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I\r\nhad let loose upon the world?\r\n\n\r\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her;\r\nit had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.\r\nThere was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an\r\nexpression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the\r\ngreatest affection. \u201cYour arrival, my dear cousin,\u201d said she, \u201cfills me with\r\nhope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.\r\nAlas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as\r\ncertainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not\r\nonly lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love,\r\nis to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall\r\nknow joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be\r\nhappy again, even after the sad death of my little William.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShe is innocent, my Elizabeth,\u201d said I, \u201cand that shall be proved; fear\r\nnothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that\r\nmade me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else\r\nprejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.\u201d She\r\nwept.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDearest niece,\u201d said my father, \u201cdry your tears. If she is, as you believe,\r\ninnocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall\r\nprevent the slightest shadow of partiality.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o\u2019clock, when the trial was to commence.\r\nMy father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I\r\naccompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of\r\njustice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of\r\nmy curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow\r\nbeings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more\r\ndreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the\r\nmurder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed\r\nqualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be\r\nobliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather\r\nwould I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\r\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been\r\nconsidered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who\r\nsuffered through me.\r\n\n\r\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her\r\ncountenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings,\r\nexquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not\r\ntremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness\r\nwhich her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of\r\nthe spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have\r\ncommitted. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained;\r\nand as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\r\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she\r\nthrew her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear\r\nseemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a\r\nlook of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.\r\n\n\r\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge,\r\nseveral witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her,\r\nwhich might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I\r\nhad. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been\r\ncommitted and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from\r\nthe spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The\r\nwoman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only\r\nreturned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about\r\neight o\u2019clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\r\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if\r\nanything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into\r\nviolent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then\r\nproduced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a\r\nfaltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child\r\nhad been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and\r\nindignation filled the court.\r\n\n\r\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\r\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.\r\nSometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she\r\ncollected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod knows,\u201d she said, \u201chow entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that\r\nmy protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple\r\nexplanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the\r\ncharacter I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable\r\ninterpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the\r\nevening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an\r\naunt at Ch\u00eane, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return,\r\nat about nine o\u2019clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of\r\nthe child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several\r\nhours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was\r\nforced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage,\r\nbeing unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of\r\nthe night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept\r\nfor a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and\r\nshe quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If\r\nshe had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.\r\nThat she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not\r\nsurprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William\r\nwas yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d continued the unhappy victim, \u201chow heavily and fatally this one\r\ncircumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when\r\nI have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning\r\nthe probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here\r\nalso I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely\r\nwould have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it\r\nthere? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why\r\nshould he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I\r\nbeg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if\r\ntheir testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned,\r\nalthough I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke\r\nwell of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty\r\nrendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this\r\nlast resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to\r\nfail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to\r\naddress the court.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d said she, \u201cthe cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather\r\nhis sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since\r\nand even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to\r\ncome forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish\r\nthrough the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak,\r\nthat I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the\r\naccused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at\r\nanother for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the\r\nmost amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein,\r\nmy aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and\r\nafterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that\r\nexcited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\r\nuncle\u2019s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached\r\nto the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate\r\nmother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the\r\nevidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She\r\nhad no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof\r\nrests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to\r\nher, so much do I esteem and value her.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth\u2019s simple and powerful appeal, but it\r\nwas excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on\r\nwhom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with\r\nthe blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not\r\nanswer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I\r\nbelieved in her innocence; I knew it. Could the d\u00e6mon who had (I did not for a\r\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the\r\ninnocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation,\r\nand when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges\r\nhad already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.\r\nThe tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence,\r\nbut the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\r\n\n\r\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court;\r\nmy lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was\r\nknown, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been\r\nthrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.\r\n\n\r\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced\r\nsensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate\r\nexpressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair\r\nthat I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine\r\nhad already confessed her guilt. \u201cThat evidence,\u201d he observed, \u201cwas hardly\r\nrequired in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our\r\njudges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\r\ndecisive.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes\r\ndeceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be\r\nif I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home, and\r\nElizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy cousin,\u201d replied I, \u201cit is decided as you may have expected; all judges had\r\nrather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But\r\nshe has confessed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\r\nJustine\u2019s innocence. \u201cAlas!\u201d said she. \u201cHow shall I ever again believe in human\r\ngoodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on\r\nthose smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any\r\nseverity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\r\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\r\njudgment and feelings to decide", "summary": "\nIn this continuation of Victor Frankenstein's narrative, he describes his scientific pursuit at Ingolstadt, where his application to study becomes increasingly obsessive. Under Professor Waldman's mentorship, Victor makes rapid progress in natural philosophy. After two years of dedicated study, he becomes fixated on discovering the principle of life, spending days and nights in charnel houses examining human remains and the process of decay.\nVictor's relentless work leads to a breakthrough - he discovers the secret of generating life and becomes capable of animating lifeless matter. Though initially thrilled with his discovery, he acknowledges its dangerous potential. He decides to create a human being of gigantic stature, about eight feet tall, to overcome the difficulty of working with minute parts. Victor works feverishly, neglecting his health and correspondence with his family, consumed by his goal of creating life.\nAfter months of gruesome work collecting materials from charnel houses and dissecting rooms, Victor finally completes his creation on a dreary November night. However, when the creature opens its eyes, Victor is horrified by what he has made. Despite selecting beautiful features, the being's appearance is hideous, with yellow skin, watery eyes, and black lips. Overwhelmed with disgust and horror, Victor flees his apartment and wanders the streets in agitation.\nWhile in this distressed state, Victor unexpectedly encounters his friend Henry Clerval, who has just arrived in Ingolstadt. Victor's joy at seeing his friend is short-lived as he falls into a nervous fever that confines him for months. Throughout his illness, he is haunted by visions of his creation and raves about it, though Clerval assumes these are delirious ravings. Victor eventually recovers with Clerval's devoted care and receives a letter from his cousin Elizabeth expressing concern over his silence.\nVictor and Clerval remain in Ingolstadt, with Victor now avoiding his previous scientific pursuits and instead studying oriental languages with his friend. As they prepare to return to Geneva in the spring, Victor receives devastating news from his father - his youngest brother William has been murdered. Upon returning home, Victor visits the scene of the crime during a thunderstorm and glimpses his creation lurking nearby, instantly understanding that the creature is responsible for William's death.\nTo Victor's horror, a young woman named Justine Moritz, a beloved servant of the Frankenstein household, has been accused of the murder after William's locket was found in her possession. Despite Victor's certainty of her innocence, he cannot reveal the true killer without sounding insane. At Justine's trial, despite character testimonies from Elizabeth and others, the evidence against Justine is overwhelming. She is condemned to death, and shockingly confesses to the crime, though Victor knows she is innocent.\nVictor is tormented by guilt, knowing that his creation is responsible for both William's death and Justine's false conviction. He alone understands the truth but cannot reveal it without being considered mad. The weight of responsibility for the tragedy that has befallen his family rests entirely on him.\n", "map": [["Victor", "pursues dangerous knowledge obsessively"], ["creature", "murders innocent William"], ["Victor", "flees from his creation"], ["Waldman", "mentors Victor's scientific pursuit"], ["scientific ambition", "leads to monstrous creation"], ["creator", "abandons his responsibility"], ["Justine", "falsely condemned for murder"], ["Victor", "conceals truth about murderer"], ["creature", "appears during lightning storm"], ["knowledge without wisdom", "destroys family happiness"], ["Victor's silence", "enables Justine's execution"], ["Clerval", "nurses Victor through illness"], ["creation", "returns to haunt creator"], ["scientific breakthrough", "becomes source of horror"], ["guilt", "consumes Victor's conscience"], ["family bonds", "destroyed by scientific ambition"], ["Elizabeth", "defends innocent Justine"], ["truth", "remains buried through fear"]]}
