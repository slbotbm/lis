My cousin wept also.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Justine!\u201d said she. \u201cWhy did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied\r\non your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so\r\nmiserable as I am now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join with\r\nmy enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?\u201d Her voice was suffocated\r\nwith sobs.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRise, my poor girl,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cwhy do you kneel, if you are innocent? I\r\nam not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every\r\nevidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report,\r\nyou say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my\r\nconfidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain\r\nabsolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other\r\nsins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor\r\nhas besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that\r\nI was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell\r\nfire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to\r\nsupport me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What\r\ncould I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\r\nmiserable.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, \u201cI thought with horror, my sweet lady,\r\nthat you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly\r\nhonoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but\r\nthe devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child!\r\nI soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that\r\nconsoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you\r\nconfess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will\r\nprove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears\r\nand prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister,\r\nperish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a\r\nmisfortune.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nJustine shook her head mournfully. \u201cI do not fear to die,\u201d she said; \u201cthat pang\r\nis past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. I\r\nleave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one\r\nunjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear\r\nlady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I\r\ncould conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of\r\nthat? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between\r\nlife and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my\r\nteeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.\r\nJustine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, \u201cDear\r\nsir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am\r\nguilty?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI could not answer. \u201cNo, Justine,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201che is more convinced of\r\nyour innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he\r\ndid not credit it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude\r\ntowards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of\r\nothers to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune, and I\r\nfeel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you,\r\ndear lady, and your cousin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained\r\nthe resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying\r\nworm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also\r\nwept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a\r\ncloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its\r\nbrightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I\r\nbore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours\r\nwith Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\r\nherself away. \u201cI wish,\u201d cried she, \u201cthat I were to die with you; I cannot live\r\nin this world of misery.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her\r\nbitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed\r\nemotion, \u201cFarewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend;\r\nmay heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last\r\nmisfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth\u2019s heart-rending eloquence failed to\r\nmove the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly\r\nsufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I\r\nreceived their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these\r\nmen, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a\r\nmadman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\r\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!\r\n\n\r\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\r\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father\u2019s woe,\r\nand the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my\r\nthrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last\r\ntears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your\r\nlamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your\r\nkinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of\r\nblood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is\r\nmirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings\r\nand spend his life in serving you\u2014he bids you weep, to shed countless tears;\r\nhappy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the\r\ndestruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad\r\ntorments!\r\n\n\r\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I\r\nbeheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine,\r\nthe first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\r\n\n\r\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been\r\nworked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and\r\ncertainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine\r\ndied, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a\r\nweight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.\r\nSleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed\r\ndeeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded\r\nmyself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of\r\nvirtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\r\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\r\nNow all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to\r\nlook back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather\r\npromise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which\r\nhurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.\r\n\n\r\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely\r\nrecovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all\r\nsound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only\r\nconsolation\u2014deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\r\n\n\r\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and\r\nhabits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene\r\nconscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the\r\ncourage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. \u201cDo you think, Victor,\u201d\r\nsaid he, \u201cthat I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I\r\nloved your brother\u201d\u2014tears came into his eyes as he spoke\u2014\u201cbut is it not a duty\r\nto the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an\r\nappearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for\r\nexcessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of\r\ndaily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have\r\nbeen the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not\r\nmingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. Now I\r\ncould only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself\r\nfrom his view.\r\n\n\r\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\r\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten\r\no\u2019clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had\r\nrendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now\r\nfree. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the\r\nboat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was\r\ncarried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I\r\nleft the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable\r\nreflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the\r\nonly unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\r\nheavenly\u2014if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted\r\ncroaking was heard only when I approached the shore\u2014often, I say, I was tempted\r\nto plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my\r\ncalamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and\r\nsuffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in\r\nmine. I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base\r\ndesertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I\r\nhad let loose among them?\r\n\n\r\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind\r\nonly that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be.\r\nRemorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils,\r\nand I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate\r\nsome new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he\r\nwould still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost\r\nefface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as\r\nanything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be\r\nconceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed,\r\nand I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly\r\nbestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge\r\nburst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest\r\npeak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I\r\nwished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on\r\nhis head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\r\n\n\r\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father\u2019s health was deeply shaken by\r\nthe horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no\r\nlonger took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her\r\nsacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just\r\ntribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer\r\nthat happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the\r\nlake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those\r\nsorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its\r\ndimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen I reflect, my dear cousin,\u201d said she, \u201con the miserable death of Justine\r\nMoritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.\r\nBefore, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books\r\nor heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they\r\nwere remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery\r\nhas come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other\u2019s\r\nblood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be\r\nguilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered,\r\nassuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the\r\nsake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a\r\nchild whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had\r\nbeen her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but\r\ncertainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society\r\nof men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the\r\nsame opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so\r\nlike the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I\r\nwere walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding\r\nand endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\r\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and\r\nperhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for\r\nthe same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in\r\neffect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and\r\nkindly taking my hand, said, \u201cMy dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These\r\nevents have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you\r\nare. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your\r\ncountenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.\r\nRemember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we\r\nlost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to\r\neach other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may\r\nreap every tranquil blessing\u2014what can disturb our peace?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift\r\nof fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she\r\nspoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the\r\ndestroyer had been near to rob me of her.\r\n\n\r\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven,\r\ncould redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was\r\nencompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The\r\nwounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze\r\nupon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\r\n\n\r\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\r\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\r\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It\r\nwas during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my\r\nsteps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity\r\nof such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My\r\nwanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it\r\nfrequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a\r\nwreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\r\n\n\r\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a\r\nmule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these\r\nrugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of\r\nAugust, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from\r\nwhich I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I\r\nplunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices\r\nthat overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks,\r\nand the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\r\nOmnipotence\u2014and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than\r\nthat which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most\r\nterrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more\r\nmagnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices\r\nof piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there\r\npeeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it\r\nwas augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining\r\npyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the\r\nhabitations of another race of beings.\r\n\n\r\nI passed the bridge of P\u00e9lissier, where the ravine, which the river forms,\r\nopened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon\r\nafter, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and\r\nsublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which\r\nI had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries,\r\nbut I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers\r\napproached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\r\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont\r\nBlanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous\r\nd\u00f4me overlooked the valley.\r\n\n\r\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\r\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\r\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\r\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents,\r\nand maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence\r\nceased to act\u2014I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the\r\nmisery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the\r\nworld, my fears, and more than all, myself\u2014or, in a more desperate fashion, I\r\nalighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\r\n\n\r\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the\r\nextreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a short space\r\nof time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played\r\nabove Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its\r\nnoisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen\r\nsensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt\r\nit as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.\r\n\n\r\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the\r\nsources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow\r\npace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.\r\nThe abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier\r\noverhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn\r\nsilence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by\r\nthe brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\r\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated\r\nice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon\r\nrent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime\r\nand magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable\r\nof receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although\r\nthey did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some\r\ndegree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded\r\nfor the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited\r\non and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had\r\ncontemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy\r\nmountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine,\r\nthe eagle, soaring amidst the clouds\u2014they all gathered round me and bade me be\r\nat peace.\r\n\n\r\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriting fled\r\nwith sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in\r\ntorrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw\r\nnot the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil\r\nand seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule\r\nwas brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.\r\nI remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier\r\nhad produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a\r\nsublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the\r\nobscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature\r\nhad indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget\r\nthe passing cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\r\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\r\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\r\n\n\r\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\r\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It\r\nis a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter\r\navalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground,\r\nsome entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the\r\nmountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is\r\nintersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above;\r\none of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even\r\nspeaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\r\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant,\r\nbut they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the\r\nvalley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and\r\ncurling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid\r\nin the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the\r\nmelancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man\r\nboast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\r\nthem more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst,\r\nand desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that\r\nblows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.\r\n\n\r\nWe rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We rise; one wand\u2019ring thought pollutes the day.\r\nWe feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\r\nIt is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The path of its departure still is free.\r\nMan\u2019s yesterday may ne\u2019er be like his morrow;\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nought may endure but mutability!\r\n\n\r\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat\r\nupon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the\r\nsurrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended\r\nupon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a\r\ntroubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The\r\nfield of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in\r\ncrossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side\r\nwhere I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\r\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the\r\nrock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the\r\nvast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits\r\nhung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight\r\nover the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with\r\nsomething like joy; I exclaimed, \u201cWandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and\r\ndo not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as\r\nyour companion, away from the joys of life.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\r\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the\r\nice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he\r\napproached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my\r\neyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold\r\ngale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous\r\nand abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage\r\nand horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal\r\ncombat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with\r\ndisdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too\r\nhorrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at\r\nfirst deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with\r\nwords expressive of furious detestation and contempt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDevil,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cdo you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce\r\nvengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or\r\nrather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the\r\nextinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so\r\ndiabolically murdered!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI expected this reception,\u201d said the d\u00e6mon. \u201cAll men hate the wretched; how,\r\nthen, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my\r\ncreator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only\r\ndissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare\r\nyou sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards\r\nyou and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will\r\nleave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death,\r\nuntil it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a\r\nvengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with your creation,\r\ncome on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently\r\nbestowed.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which\r\ncan arm one being against the existence of another.\r\n\n\r\nHe easily eluded me and said,\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my\r\ndevoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?\r\nLife, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I\r\nwill defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my\r\nheight is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted\r\nto set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild\r\nand docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the\r\nwhich thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and\r\ntrample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and\r\naffection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy\r\nAdam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no\r\nmisdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I\r\nwas benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall\r\nagain be virtuous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBegone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we\r\nare enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must\r\nfall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye\r\nupon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me,\r\nFrankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I\r\nnot alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather\r\nfrom your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The\r\ndesert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many\r\ndays; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\r\nonly one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are\r\nkinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my\r\nexistence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.\r\nShall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies.\r\nI am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power\r\nto recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you\r\nto make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others,\r\nshall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\r\nmoved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that,\r\nabandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The\r\nguilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own\r\ndefence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of\r\nmurder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own\r\ncreature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me;\r\nlisten to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your\r\nhands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you call to my remembrance,\u201d I rejoined, \u201ccircumstances of which I\r\nshudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be\r\nthe day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse\r\nmyself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond\r\nexpression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or\r\nnot. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThus I relieve thee, my creator,\u201d he said, and placed his hated hands before\r\nmy eyes, which I flung from me with violence; \u201cthus I take from thee a sight\r\nwhich you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By\r\nthe virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is\r\nlong and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine\r\nsensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the\r\nheavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and\r\nilluminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you\r\nit rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\r\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own\r\nspeedy ruin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full,\r\nand I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments\r\nthat he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly\r\nurged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto\r\nsupposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a\r\nconfirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what\r\nthe duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render\r\nhim happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to\r\ncomply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the\r\nopposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\r\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and\r\ndepressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire\r\nwhich my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my\r\nbeing; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange\r\nmultiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the\r\nsame time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish\r\nbetween the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger\r\nlight pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness\r\nthen came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening\r\nmy eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I\r\nbelieve, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\r\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or\r\nsight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles\r\nwhich I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more\r\noppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where\r\nI could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by\r\nthe side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger\r\nand thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries\r\nwhich I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\r\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were,\r\ninstinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment,\r\non a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were\r\ninsufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless,\r\nmiserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain\r\ninvade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSoon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\r\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.\r\n[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened\r\nmy path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under\r\none of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat\r\ndown upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I\r\nfelt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my\r\nears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\r\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSeveral changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly\r\nlessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I\r\ngradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the\r\ntrees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first\r\ndiscovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from\r\nthe throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light\r\nfrom my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that\r\nsurrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which\r\ncanopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but\r\nwas unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\r\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence\r\nagain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form,\r\nshowed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had by this\r\ntime become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes\r\nbecame accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I\r\ndistinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.\r\nI found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the\r\nblackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by\r\nsome wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I\r\nexperienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but\r\nquickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the\r\nsame cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of\r\nthe fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected\r\nsome branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and\r\nsat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed\r\nnear the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by\r\ntouching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\r\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful\r\nsupply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the\r\ngreatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with\r\ndry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my\r\ncloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I\r\nuncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed\r\nthis also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they\r\nwere nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that\r\nthe fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was\r\nuseful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had\r\nleft had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered\r\nfrom the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner,\r\nplacing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\r\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFood, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in\r\nvain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I\r\nresolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where\r\nthe few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration\r\nI exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through\r\naccident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious\r\nconsideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt\r\nto supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\r\ntowards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at length\r\ndiscovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night\r\nbefore, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was\r\ndisconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that\r\ncovered the ground.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at\r\nlength I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been\r\nbuilt for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I\r\nexamined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered.\r\nAn old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.\r\nHe turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting\r\nthe hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\r\nhardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before\r\nseen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the\r\nappearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground\r\nwas dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as\r\nPand\u00e6monium appeared to the d\u00e6mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake\r\nof fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd\u2019s breakfast, which\r\nconsisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not\r\nlike. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone\r\nbrightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and,\r\ndepositing the remains of the peasant\u2019s breakfast in a wallet I found, I\r\nproceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a\r\nvillage. How miraculous did this appear! The huts, the neater cottages, and\r\nstately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gardens,\r\nthe milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages,\r\nallured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly\r\nplaced my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the\r\nwomen fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me,\r\nuntil, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\r\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite\r\nbare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the\r\nvillage. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant\r\nappearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.\r\nMy place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with\r\ndifficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which\r\nformed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by\r\ninnumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however\r\nmiserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity\r\nof man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the\r\nadjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.\r\nIt was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides\r\nwhich were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open,\r\nand by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be\r\nperceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\r\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that\r\nwas sufficient for me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHaving thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired,\r\nfor I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my\r\ntreatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first, however,\r\nprovided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I\r\npurloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my\r\nhand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little\r\nraised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney\r\nof the cottage it was tolerably warm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBeing thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should\r\noccur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to\r\nthe bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank\r\nearth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to\r\nprocure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small\r\nchink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my\r\nhovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since\r\nfound cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\r\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was\r\nplaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and\r\nin about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now\r\npartly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the\r\nburden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.\r\nUttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head\r\nand bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared.\r\nPresently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the\r\nfield behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house\r\nand sometimes in the yard.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had\r\nformerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In\r\none of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye\r\ncould just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible,\r\nwhitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small\r\nfire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.\r\nThe young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took\r\nsomething out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside\r\nthe old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds\r\nsweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight,\r\neven to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver\r\nhair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while\r\nthe gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\r\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which\r\nthe old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few\r\nsounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised\r\nher and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a\r\npeculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure,\r\nsuch as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or\r\nfood; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSoon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of\r\nwood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and\r\ntaking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and\r\nthe youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf\r\nand a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some\r\nroots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. She\r\nafterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and\r\nappeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been\r\nemployed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\r\ncottage together.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his\r\ncompanions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal\r\nwas quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in arranging the\r\ncottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes,\r\nleaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast\r\nbetween these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a\r\ncountenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and\r\ngraceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry,\r\nyet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old\r\nman returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he\r\nhad used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNight quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers\r\nhad a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find\r\nthat the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in\r\nwatching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion\r\nwere employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old\r\nman again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had\r\nenchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not\r\nto play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\r\nharmony of the old man\u2019s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found\r\nthat he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or\r\nletters.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished\r\ntheir lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the\r\nday. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I\r\nlonged to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had\r\nsuffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever\r\ncourse of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the\r\npresent I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to\r\ndiscover the motives which influenced their actions.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged\r\nthe cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young\r\nman was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious\r\noccupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed\r\nhis leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed\r\nthe love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their\r\nvenerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of\r\naffection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent\r\nsmiles.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart\r\nand appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply\r\naffected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange\r\nthat I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these\r\ngentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my\r\neyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious\r\nviands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\r\nthey enjoyed one another\u2019s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of\r\naffection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express\r\npain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention\r\nand time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the\r\nuneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil\r\nin a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the\r\nvegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little\r\nduring the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.\r\nThey often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially\r\nthe two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\r\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the\r\nnight, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found\r\nthat in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied\r\nmyself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their\r\nlabours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting\r\nwood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use\r\nof which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the\r\nconsumption of several days.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened\r\nthe door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of\r\nwood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth\r\njoined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did\r\nnot go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and\r\ncultivating the garden.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these\r\npeople possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one\r\nanother by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes\r\nproduced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of\r\nthe hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to\r\nbecome acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this\r\npurpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having\r\nany apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue\r\nby which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application,\r\nhowever, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of\r\nthe moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the\r\nmost familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, fire,\r\nmilk, bread, and wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers\r\nthemselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the\r\nold man had only one, which was father. The girl was called\r\nsister or Agatha, and the youth Felix, brother, or\r\nson. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas\r\nappropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I\r\ndistinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or\r\napply them, such as good, dearest, unhappy.\n\n\r\n\u201cI spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the\r\ncottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt\r\ndepressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw few human\r\nbeings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their\r\nharsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of\r\nmy friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his\r\nchildren, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their\r\nmelancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness\r\nthat bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes\r\nsometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived;\r\nbut I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\r\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix.\r\nHe was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he\r\nappeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance\r\nwas more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister,\r\nespecially when he addressed the old man.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the\r\ndispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,\r\nFelix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that\r\npeeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had\r\nrisen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house,\r\ndrew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his\r\nperpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\r\nhand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer,\r\nbecause he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no\r\nwood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little\r\nto do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered\r\nthat he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I\r\nconjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he\r\nunderstood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that\r\npossible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as\r\nsigns? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to\r\nfollow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the\r\nendeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover\r\nmyself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first\r\nbecome master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\r\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\r\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers\u2014their grace, beauty, and\r\ndelicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a\r\ntransparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed\r\nI who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was\r\nin reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of\r\ndespondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal\r\neffects of this miserable deformity.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I\r\nbeheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more\r\nemployed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.\r\nTheir food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they\r\nprocured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the\r\ngarden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the\r\nseason advanced.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not\r\nrain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This\r\nfrequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season\r\nbecame far more pleasant than it had been.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the\r\nmotions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations,\r\nI slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they\r\nhad retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went\r\ninto the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I\r\nreturned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and\r\nperformed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that\r\nthese labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\r\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good spirit,\r\nwonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and\r\nfeelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix\r\nappeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it\r\nmight be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I\r\nslept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle\r\nAgatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as\r\nsuperior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my\r\nimagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their\r\nreception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\r\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\r\nafterwards their love.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThese thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the\r\nacquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and\r\nalthough my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I\r\npronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass\r\nand the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate,\r\nalthough his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and\r\nexecration.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of\r\nthe earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves\r\ndispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The\r\nbirds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the\r\ntrees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time\r\nbefore, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the\r\nenchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the\r\npresent was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and\r\nanticipations of joy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that\r\nimpressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It\r\nsurprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the\r\nmost beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a\r\nthousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from\r\nlabour\u2014the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him\u2014that\r\nI observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed\r\nfrequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his\r\nmanner that he inquired the cause of his son\u2019s sorrow. Felix replied in a\r\ncheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped\r\nat the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady\r\nwas dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a\r\nquestion, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent,\r\nthe name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my\r\nfriends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she\r\nsaw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and\r\nexpression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes\r\nwere dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion,\r\nand her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFelix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow\r\nvanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of\r\nwhich I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek\r\nflushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the\r\nstranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from\r\nher lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and\r\ncalled her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not\r\nappear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\r\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took\r\nplace between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man\u2019s\r\nfeet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her\r\naffectionately.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and\r\nappeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor\r\nherself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not\r\ncomprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage,\r\ndispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed\r\npeculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the\r\never-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to\r\nher brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful\r\nuntil she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\r\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by\r\nthe frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them,\r\nthat she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly\r\noccurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.\r\nThe stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them,\r\nindeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated\r\nFelix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, \u2018Good night sweet Safie.\u2019 He\r\nsat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition\r\nof her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their\r\nconversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty\r\ntowards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations\r\nof Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking\r\nhis guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew\r\ntears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a\r\nrich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined\r\nit. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but\r\nunlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured and\r\nsaid some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he\r\nappeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by\r\nher music.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy\r\nhad taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always\r\ngay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that\r\nin two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green\r\nbanks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes,\r\nstars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the\r\nnights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to\r\nme, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early\r\nrising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of\r\nmeeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village\r\nwhich I entered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the\r\nlanguage; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who\r\nunderstood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended\r\nand could imitate almost every word that was spoken.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhile I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was\r\ntaught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and\r\ndelight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney\u2019s Ruins of\r\nEmpires. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\r\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work,\r\nhe said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern\r\nauthors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view\r\nof the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight\r\ninto the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the\r\nearth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental\r\nactivity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early\r\nRomans\u2014of their subsequent degenerating\u2014of the decline of that mighty empire,\r\nof chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American\r\nhemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThese wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed,\r\nat once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He\r\nappeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all\r\nthat can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man\r\nappeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and\r\nvicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a\r\ncondition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long\r\ntime I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\r\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and\r\nbloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEvery conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I\r\nlistened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange\r\nsystem of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of\r\nproperty, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble\r\nblood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions\r\nmost esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united\r\nwith riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but\r\nwithout either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond\r\nand a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And\r\nwhat was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew\r\nthat I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\r\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the\r\nsame nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser\r\ndiet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my\r\nstature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like\r\nme. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and\r\nwhom all men disowned?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I\r\ntried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had\r\nfor ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations\r\nof hunger, thirst, and heat!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once\r\nseized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all\r\nthought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the\r\nsensation of pain, and that was death\u2014a state which I feared yet did not\r\nunderstand. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and\r\namiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with\r\nthem, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\r\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming\r\none among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the\r\ncharming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the\r\nlively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy\r\nwretch!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOther lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\r\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted\r\non the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all\r\nthe life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how\r\nthe mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all\r\nthe various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual\r\nbonds.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days,\r\nno mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past\r\nlife was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my\r\nearliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had\r\nnever yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.\r\nWhat was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans", "summary": "\nFollowing the condemnation of Justine for William's murder, Victor and Elizabeth visit her in prison. Though Justine confesses to the crime, she reveals to them that her confession was false, coerced by her confessor who threatened her with excommunication. Despite knowing her innocence, Victor remains silent about the true murderer - his creation. The next day, Justine is executed, leaving Victor consumed by guilt and remorse, knowing that he is the true cause of both William's and Justine's deaths.\nVictor's mental health deteriorates as he struggles with his secret burden. He withdraws from society, finding solitude his only consolation. His father attempts to comfort him, unaware of the true source of Victor's anguish. The family retreats to their house at Belrive, where Victor often spends nights alone on the lake, contemplating suicide but restrained by thoughts of his family. His hatred for the creature grows intense, yet he fears what further harm it might cause to those he loves.\nSeeking escape from his torment, Victor journeys to the valley of Chamounix in the Alps. The magnificent mountain scenery temporarily soothes his spirit, with the grandeur of Mont Blanc and the sublime glaciers providing some respite from his anguish. However, during an excursion to Montanvert, Victor unexpectedly encounters his creation on the glacier.\nVictor immediately expresses hatred and threatens to destroy the creature, but the being eloquently pleads for understanding. The creature acknowledges Victor as his creator and appeals for compassion, describing himself as miserable and abandoned. He convinces Victor to listen to his story, arguing that even those accused of crimes deserve to be heard. Despite his revulsion, Victor agrees to follow the creature to a hut and hear his tale.\nThe creature begins his narrative by describing his earliest memories after his creation - his confusion as his senses developed, his discovery of basic needs like food and shelter, and his first encounters with humans who reacted to him with fear and violence. He finds refuge in a hovel adjoining a cottage, where he secretly observes a family consisting of an old blind man, Felix, and Agatha. Through watching them, he begins to learn language, emotional expressions, and human relationships.\nThe creature describes how he learned to speak and read by observing the family teaching a foreign woman named Safie. His education advances rapidly as he listens to Felix reading books to Safie, including Volney's \"Ruins of Empires,\" which gives him knowledge of history and human society. This expanding awareness brings both wonder and pain, as he realizes his own isolation and monstrosity.\nAs the creature gains understanding of human connections - family bonds, friendship, love - he becomes increasingly aware of his own loneliness and alienation. He questions his identity and origin, lamenting that he has no family or relations. His growing comprehension of his difference from humans and his lack of place in society intensifies his suffering. Despite his benevolent feelings toward the cottagers, he knows he cannot reveal himself to them, leaving him in a state of profound existential anguish.\n", "map": [["Victor", "burdened by knowledge of true murderer"], ["Justine", "falsely confesses under religious coercion"], ["creature", "learns language through hidden observation"], ["Victor", "contemplates suicide on lake"], ["sublime nature", "temporarily alleviates Victor's suffering"], ["knowledge", "increases creature's existential pain"], ["creator", "abandons responsibility for creation"], ["education", "fosters creature's self-awareness and alienation"], ["Victor", "silently enables Justine's execution"], ["creature", "develops compassion by watching family"], ["cottage family", "unknowingly teaches creature humanity"], ["Victor", "agrees to hear creature's narrative"], ["creature", "performs secret acts of kindness"], ["Safie", "unintentionally aids creature's education"], ["creature", "questions his place in creation"], ["Victor", "fears creature's future violent actions"], ["creature", "pleads eloquently for understanding"], ["human connection", "remains beyond creature's reach"]]}
