Some of\r\nthe best English writers upon commerce set out with observing, that the wealth\r\nof a country consists, not in its gold and silver only, but in its lands,\r\nhouses, and consumable goods of all different kinds. In the course of their\r\nreasonings, however, the lands, houses, and consumable goods, seem to slip out\r\nof their memory; and the strain of their argument frequently supposes that all\r\nwealth consists in gold and silver, and that to multiply those metals is the\r\ngreat object of national industry and commerce.\r\n\n\r\nThe two principles being established, however, that wealth consisted in gold\r\nand silver, and that those metals could be brought into a country which had no\r\nmines, only by the balance of trade, or by exporting to a greater value than it\r\nimported; it necessarily became the great object of political economy to\r\ndiminish as much as possible the importation of foreign goods for home\r\nconsumption, and to increase as much as possible the exportation of the produce\r\nof domestic industry. Its two great engines for enriching the country,\r\ntherefore, were restraints upon importation, and encouragement to exportation.\r\n\n\r\nThe restraints upon importation were of two kinds.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for home\r\nconsumption as could be produced at home, from whatever country they were\r\nimported.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds, from\r\nthose particular countries with which the balance of trade was supposed to be\r\ndisadvantageous.\r\n\n\r\nThose different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties, and sometimes in\r\nabsolute prohibitions.\r\n\n\r\nExportation was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks, sometimes by bounties,\r\nsometimes by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign states, and\r\nsometimes by the establishment of colonies in distant countries.\r\n\n\r\nDrawbacks were given upon two different occasions. When the home manufactures\r\nwere subject to any duty or excise, either the whole or a part of it was\r\nfrequently drawn back upon their exportation; and when foreign goods liable to\r\na duty were imported, in order to be exported again, either the whole or a part\r\nof this duty was sometimes given back upon such exportation.\r\n\n\r\nBounties were given for the encouragement, either of some beginning\r\nmanufactures, or of such sorts of industry of other kinds as were supposed to\r\ndeserve particular favour.\r\n\n\r\nBy advantageous treaties of commerce, particular privileges were procured in\r\nsome foreign state for the goods and merchants of the country, beyond what were\r\ngranted to those of other countries.\r\n\n\r\nBy the establishment of colonies in distant countries, not only particular\r\nprivileges, but a monopoly was frequently procured for the goods and merchants\r\nof the country which established them.\r\n\n\r\nThe two sorts of restraints upon importation above mentioned, together with\r\nthese four encouragements to exportation, constitute the six principal means by\r\nwhich the commercial system proposes to increase the quantity of gold and\r\nsilver in any country, by turning the balance of trade in its favour. I shall\r\nconsider each of them in a particular chapter, and, without taking much farther\r\nnotice of their supposed tendency to bring money into the country, I shall\r\nexamine chiefly what are likely to be the effects of each of them upon the\r\nannual produce of its industry. According as they tend either to increase or\r\ndiminish the value of this annual produce, they must evidently tend either to\r\nincrease or diminish the real wealth and revenue of the country.\r\n\n\r\nBy restraining, either by high duties, or by absolute prohibitions, the\r\nimportation of such goods from foreign countries as can be produced at home,\r\nthe monopoly of the home market is more or less secured to the domestic\r\nindustry employed in producing them. Thus the prohibition of importing either\r\nlive cattle or salt provisions from foreign countries, secures to the graziers\r\nof Great Britain the monopoly of the home market for butcher\u2019s meat. The\r\nhigh duties upon the importation of corn, which, in times of moderate plenty,\r\namount to a prohibition, give a like advantage to the growers of that\r\ncommodity. The prohibition of the importation of foreign woollen is equally\r\nfavourable to the woollen manufacturers. The silk manufacture, though\r\naltogether employed upon foreign materials, has lately obtained the same\r\nadvantage. The linen manufacture has not yet obtained it, but is making great\r\nstrides towards it. Many other sorts of manufactures have, in the same manner\r\nobtained in Great Britain, either altogether, or very nearly, a monopoly\r\nagainst their countrymen. The variety of goods, of which the importation into\r\nGreat Britain is prohibited, either absolutely, or under certain circumstances,\r\ngreatly exceeds what can easily be suspected by those who are not well\r\nacquainted with the laws of the customs.\r\n\n\r\nThat this monopoly of the home market frequently gives great encouragement to\r\nthat particular species of industry which enjoys it, and frequently turns\r\ntowards that employment a greater share of both the labour and stock of the\r\nsociety than would otherwise have gone to it, cannot be doubted. But whether it\r\ntends either to increase the general industry of the society, or to give it the\r\nmost advantageous direction, is not, perhaps, altogether so evident.\r\n\n\r\nThe general industry of the society can never exceed what the capital of the\r\nsociety can employ. As the number of workmen that can be kept in employment by\r\nany particular person must bear a certain proportion to his capital, so the\r\nnumber of those that can be continually employed by all the members of a great\r\nsociety must bear a certain proportion to the whole capital of the society, and\r\nnever can exceed that proportion. No regulation of commerce can increase the\r\nquantity of industry in any society beyond what its capital can maintain. It\r\ncan only divert a part of it into a direction into which it might not otherwise\r\nhave gone; and it is by no means certain that this artificial direction is\r\nlikely to be more advantageous to the society, than that into which it would\r\nhave gone of its own accord.\r\n\n\r\nEvery individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most\r\nadvantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own\r\nadvantage, indeed, and not that of the society, which he has in view. But the\r\nstudy of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily, leads him to\r\nprefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he\r\ncan, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry,\r\nprovided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal\r\nless than the ordinary profits of stock.\r\n\n\r\nThus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally\r\nprefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign\r\ntrade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is\r\nnever so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of\r\nconsumption. He can know better the character and situation of the persons whom\r\nhe trusts; and if he should happen to be deceived, he knows better the laws of\r\nthe country from which he must seek redress. In the carrying trade, the capital\r\nof the merchant is, as it were, divided between two foreign countries, and no\r\npart of it is ever necessarily brought home, or placed under his own immediate\r\nview and command. The capital which an Amsterdam merchant employs in carrying\r\ncorn from Koningsberg to Lisbon, and fruit and wine from Lisbon to Koningsberg,\r\nmust generally be the one half of it at Koningsberg, and the other half at\r\nLisbon. No part of it need ever come to Amsterdam. The natural residence of\r\nsuch a merchant should either be at Koningsberg or Lisbon; and it can only be\r\nsome very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the residence of\r\nAmsterdam. The uneasiness, however, which he feels at being separated so far\r\nfrom his capital, generally determines him to bring part both of the\r\nKoningsberg goods which he destines for the market of Lisbon, and of the Lisbon\r\ngoods which he destines for that of Koningsberg, to Amsterdam; and though this\r\nnecessarily subjects him to a double charge of loading and unloading as well as\r\nto the payment of some duties and customs, yet, for the sake of having some\r\npart of his capital always under his own view and command, he willingly submits\r\nto this extraordinary charge; and it is in this manner that every country which\r\nhas any considerable share of the carrying trade, becomes always the emporium,\r\nor general market, for the goods of all the different countries whose trade it\r\ncarries on. The merchant, in order to save a second loading and unloading,\r\nendeavours always to sell in the home market, as much of the goods of all those\r\ndifferent countries as he can; and thus, so far as he can, to convert his\r\ncarrying trade into a foreign trade of consumption. A merchant, in the same\r\nmanner, who is engaged in the foreign trade of consumption, when he collects\r\ngoods for foreign markets, will always be glad, upon equal or nearly equal\r\nprofits, to sell as great a part of them at home as he can. He saves himself\r\nthe risk and trouble of exportation, when, so far as he can, he thus converts\r\nhis foreign trade of consumption into a home trade. Home is in this manner the\r\ncentre, if I may say so, round which the capitals of the inhabitants of every\r\ncountry are continually circulating, and towards which they are always tending,\r\nthough, by particular causes, they may sometimes be driven off and repelled\r\nfrom it towards more distant employments. But a capital employed in the home\r\ntrade, it has already been shown, necessarily puts into motion a greater\r\nquantity of domestic industry, and gives revenue and employment to a greater\r\nnumber of the inhabitants of the country, than an equal capital employed in the\r\nforeign trade of consumption; and one employed in the foreign trade of\r\nconsumption has the same advantage over an equal capital employed in the\r\ncarrying trade. Upon equal, or only nearly equal profits, therefore, every\r\nindividual naturally inclines to employ his capital in the manner in which it\r\nis likely to afford the greatest support to domestic industry, and to give\r\nrevenue and employment to the greatest number of people of his own country.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic\r\nindustry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce\r\nmay be of the greatest possible value.\r\n\n\r\nThe produce of industry is what it adds to the subject or materials upon which\r\nit is employed. In proportion as the value of this produce is great or small,\r\nso will likewise be the profits of the employer. But it is only for the sake of\r\nprofit that any man employs a capital in the support of industry; and he will\r\nalways, therefore, endeavour to employ it in the support of that industry of\r\nwhich the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, or to exchange for the\r\ngreatest quantity either of money or of other goods.\r\n\n\r\nBut the annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the\r\nexchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry, or rather is\r\nprecisely the same thing with that exchangeable value. As every individual,\r\ntherefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the\r\nsupport of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce\r\nmaybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the\r\nannual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither\r\nintends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it.\r\nBy preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends\r\nonly his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its\r\nproduce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is\r\nin this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end\r\nwhich was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society\r\nthat it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes\r\nthat of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\r\nI have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public\r\ngood. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very\r\nfew words need be employed in dissuading them from it.\r\n\n\r\nWhat is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and of\r\nwhich the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every individual, it\r\nis evident, can in his local situation judge much better than any statesman or\r\nlawgiver can do for him. The statesman, who should attempt to direct private\r\npeople in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load\r\nhimself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could\r\nsafely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate\r\nwhatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who\r\nhad folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.\r\n\n\r\nTo give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic industry, in\r\nany particular art or manufacture, is in some measure to direct private people\r\nin what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and must in almost all\r\ncases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation. If the produce of domestic\r\ncan be brought there as cheap as that of foreign industry, the regulation is\r\nevidently useless. If it cannot, it must generally be hurtful. It is the maxim\r\nof every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it\r\nwill cost him more to make than to buy. The tailor does not attempt to make his\r\nown shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemaker does not attempt to\r\nmake his own clothes, but employs a tailor. The farmer attempts to make neither\r\nthe one nor the other, but employs those different artificers. All of them find\r\nit for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they\r\nhave some advantage over their neighbours, and to purchase with a part of its\r\nproduce, or, what is the same thing, with the price of a part of it, whatever\r\nelse they have occasion for.\r\n\n\r\nWhat is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in\r\nthat of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity\r\ncheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of\r\nthe produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some\r\nadvantage. The general industry of the country being always in proportion to\r\nthe capital which employs it, will not thereby be diminished, no more than that\r\nof the abovementioned artificers; but only left to find out the way in which it\r\ncan be employed with the greatest advantage. It is certainly not employed to\r\nthe greatest advantage, when it is thus directed towards an object which it can\r\nbuy cheaper than it can make. The value of its annual produce is certainly more\r\nor less diminished, when it is thus turned away from producing commodities\r\nevidently of more value than the commodity which it is directed to produce.\r\nAccording to the supposition, that commodity could be purchased from foreign\r\ncountries cheaper than it can be made at home; it could therefore have been\r\npurchased with a part only of the commodities, or, what is the same thing, with\r\na part only of the price of the commodities, which the industry employed by an\r\nequal capital would have produced at home, had it been left to follow its\r\nnatural course. The industry of the country, therefore, is thus turned away\r\nfrom a more to a less advantageous employment; and the exchangeable value of\r\nits annual produce, instead of being increased, according to the intention of\r\nthe lawgiver, must necessarily be diminished by every such regulation.\r\n\n\r\nBy means of such regulations, indeed, a particular manufacture may sometimes be\r\nacquired sooner than it could have been otherwise, and after a certain time may\r\nbe made at home as cheap, or cheaper, than in the foreign country. But though\r\nthe industry of the society may be thus carried with advantage into a\r\nparticular channel sooner than it could have been otherwise, it will by no\r\nmeans follow that the sum-total, either of its industry, or of its revenue, can\r\never be augmented by any such regulation. The industry of the society can\r\naugment only in proportion as its capital augments, and its capital can augment\r\nonly in proportion to what can be gradually saved out of its revenue. But the\r\nimmediate effect of every such regulation is to diminish its revenue; and what\r\ndiminishes its revenue is certainly not very likely to augment its capital\r\nfaster than it would have augmented of its own accord, had both capital and\r\nindustry been left to find out their natural employments.\r\n\n\r\nThough, for want of such regulations, the society should never acquire the\r\nproposed manufacture, it would not upon that account necessarily be the poorer\r\nin anyone period of its duration. In every period of its duration its whole\r\ncapital and industry might still have been employed, though upon different\r\nobjects, in the manner that was most advantageous at the time. In every period\r\nits revenue might have been the greatest which its capital could afford, and\r\nboth capital and revenue might have been augmented with the greatest possible\r\nrapidity.\r\n\n\r\nThe natural advantages which one country has over another, in producing\r\nparticular commodities, are sometimes so great, that it is acknowledged by all\r\nthe world to be in vain to struggle with them. By means of glasses, hot-beds,\r\nand hot-walls, very good grapes can be raised in Scotland, and very good wine,\r\ntoo, can be made of them, at about thirty times the expense for which at least\r\nequally good can be brought from foreign countries. Would it be a reasonable\r\nlaw to prohibit the importation of all foreign wines, merely to encourage the\r\nmaking of claret and Burgundy in Scotland? But if there would be a manifest\r\nabsurdity in turning towards any employment thirty times more of the capital\r\nand industry of the country than would be necessary to purchase from foreign\r\ncountries an equal quantity of the commodities wanted, there must be an\r\nabsurdity, though not altogether so glaring, yet exactly of the same kind, in\r\nturning towards any such employment a thirtieth, or even a three hundredth part\r\nmore of either. Whether the advantages which one country has over another be\r\nnatural or acquired, is in this respect of no consequence. As long as the one\r\ncountry has those advantages, and the other wants them, it will always be more\r\nadvantageous for the latter rather to buy of the former than to make. It is an\r\nacquired advantage only, which one artificer has over his neighbour, who\r\nexercises another trade; and yet they both find it more advantageous to buy of\r\none another, than to make what does not belong to their particular trades.\r\n\n\r\nMerchants and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest advantage\r\nfrom this monopoly of the home market. The prohibition of the importation of\r\nforeign cattle and of salt provisions, together with the high duties upon\r\nforeign corn, which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition, are\r\nnot near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of Great Britain, as other\r\nregulations of the same kind are to its merchants and manufacturers.\r\nManufactures, those of the finer kind especially, are more easily transported\r\nfrom one country to another than corn or cattle. It is in the fetching and\r\ncarrying manufactures, accordingly, that foreign trade is chiefly employed. In\r\nmanufactures, a very small advantage will enable foreigners to undersell our\r\nown workmen, even in the home market. It will require a very great one to\r\nenable them to do so in the rude produce of the soil. If the free importation\r\nof foreign manufactures were permitted, several of the home manufactures would\r\nprobably suffer, and some of them perhaps go to ruin altogether, and a\r\nconsiderable part of the stock and industry at present employed in them, would\r\nbe forced to find out some other employment. But the freest importation of the\r\nrude produce of the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\n\r\nIf the importation of foreign cattle, for example, were made ever so free, so\r\nfew could be imported, that the grazing trade of Great Britain could be little\r\naffected by it. Live cattle are, perhaps, the only commodity of which the\r\ntransportation is more expensive by sea than by land. By land they carry\r\nthemselves to market. By sea, not only the cattle, but their food and their\r\nwater too, must be carried at no small expense and inconveniency. The short sea\r\nbetween Ireland and Great Britain, indeed, renders the importation of Irish\r\ncattle more easy. But though the free importation of them, which was lately\r\npermitted only for a limited time, were rendered perpetual, it could have no\r\nconsiderable effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great Britain. Those\r\nparts of Great Britain which border upon the Irish sea are all grazing\r\ncountries. Irish cattle could never be imported for their use, but must be\r\ndrove through those very extensive countries, at no small expense and\r\ninconveniency, before they could arrive at their proper market. Fat cattle\r\ncould not be drove so far. Lean cattle, therefore, could only be imported; and\r\nsuch importation could interfere not with the interest of the feeding or\r\nfattening countries, to which, by reducing the price of lean cattle it would\r\nrather be advantageous, but with that of the breeding countries only. The small\r\nnumber of Irish cattle imported since their importation was permitted, together\r\nwith the good price at which lean cattle still continue to sell, seem to\r\ndemonstrate, that even the breeding countries of Great Britain are never likely\r\nto be much affected by the free importation of Irish cattle. The common people\r\nof Ireland, indeed, are said to have sometimes opposed with violence the\r\nexportation of their cattle. But if the exporters had found any great advantage\r\nin continuing the trade, they could easily, when the law was on their side,\r\nhave conquered this mobbish opposition.\r\n\n\r\nFeeding and fattening countries, besides, must always be highly improved,\r\nwhereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated. The high price of lean\r\ncattle, by augmenting the value of uncultivated land, is like a bounty against\r\nimprovement. To any country which was highly improved throughout, it would be\r\nmore advantageous to import its lean cattle than to breed them. The province of\r\nHolland, accordingly, is said to follow this maxim at present. The mountains of\r\nScotland, Wales, and Northumberland, indeed, are countries not capable of much\r\nimprovement, and seem destined by nature to be the breeding countries of Great\r\nBritain. The freest importation of foreign cattle could have no other effect\r\nthan to hinder those breeding countries from taking advantage of the increasing\r\npopulation and improvement of the rest of the kingdom, from raising their price\r\nto an exorbitant height, and from laying a real tax upon all the more improved\r\nand cultivated parts of the country.\r\n\n\r\nThe freest importation of salt provisions, in the same manner, could have as\r\nlittle effect upon the interest of the graziers of Great Britain as that of\r\nlive cattle. Salt provisions are not only a very bulky commodity, but when\r\ncompared with fresh meat they are a commodity both of worse quality, and, as\r\nthey cost more labour and expense, of higher price. They could never,\r\ntherefore, come into competition with the fresh meat, though they might with\r\nthe salt provisions of the country. They might be used for victualling ships\r\nfor distant voyages, and such like uses, but could never make any considerable\r\npart of the food of the people. The small quantity of salt provisions imported\r\nfrom Ireland since their importation was rendered free, is an experimental\r\nproof that our graziers have nothing to apprehend from it. It does not appear\r\nthat the price of butcher\u2019s meat has ever been sensibly affected by it.\r\n\n\r\nEven the free importation of foreign corn could very little affect the interest\r\nof the farmers of Great Britain. Corn is a much more bulky commodity than\r\nbutcher\u2019s meat. A pound of wheat at a penny is as dear as a pound of\r\nbutcher\u2019s meat at fourpence. The small quantity of foreign corn imported\r\neven in times of the greatest scarcity, may satisfy our farmers that they can\r\nhave nothing to fear from the freest importation. The average quantity\r\nimported, one year with another, amounts only, according to the very well\r\ninformed author of the Tracts upon the Corn Trade, to 23,728 quarters of all\r\nsorts of grain, and does not exceed the five hundredth and seventy-one part of\r\nthe annual consumption. But as the bounty upon corn occasions a greater\r\nexportation in years of plenty, so it must, of consequence, occasion a greater\r\nimportation in years of scarcity, than in the actual state of tillage would\r\notherwise take place. By means of it, the plenty of one year does not\r\ncompensate the scarcity of another; and as the average quantity exported is\r\nnecessarily augmented by it, so must likewise, in the actual state of tillage,\r\nthe average quantity imported. If there were no bounty, as less corn would be\r\nexported, so it is probable that, one year with another, less would be imported\r\nthan at present. The corn-merchants, the fetchers and carriers of corn between\r\nGreat Britain and foreign countries, would have much less employment, and might\r\nsuffer considerably; but the country gentlemen and farmers could suffer very\r\nlittle. It is in the corn-merchants, accordingly, rather than the country\r\ngentlemen and farmers, that I have observed the greatest anxiety for the\r\nrenewal and continuation of the bounty.\r\n\n\r\nCountry gentlemen and farmers are, to their great honour, of all people, the\r\nleast subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly. The undertaker of a great\r\nmanufactory is sometimes alarmed if another work of the same kind is\r\nestablished within twenty miles of him; the Dutch undertaker of the woollen\r\nmanufacture at Abbeville, stipulated that no work of the same kind should be\r\nestablished within thirty leagues of that city. Farmers and country gentlemen,\r\non the contrary, are generally disposed rather to promote, than to obstruct,\r\nthe cultivation and improvement of their neighbours farms and estates. They\r\nhave no secrets, such as those of the greater part of manufacturers, but are\r\ngenerally rather fond of communicating to their neighbours, and of extending as\r\nfar as possible any new practice which they may have found to be advantageous.\r\n\u201cPius quaestus\u201d, says old Cato, \u201cstabilissimusque, minimeque\r\ninvidiosus; minimeque male cogitantes sunt, qui in eo studio occupati\r\nsunt.\u201d Country gentlemen and farmers, dispersed in different parts of the\r\ncountry, cannot so easily combine as merchants and manufacturers, who being\r\ncollected into towns, and accustomed to that exclusive corporation spirit which\r\nprevails in them, naturally endeavour to obtain, against all their countrymen,\r\nthe same exclusive privilege which they generally possess against the\r\ninhabitants of their respective towns. They accordingly seem to have been the\r\noriginal inventors of those restraints upon the importation of foreign goods,\r\nwhich secure to them the monopoly of the home market. It was probably in\r\nimitation of them, and to put themselves upon a level with those who, they\r\nfound, were disposed to oppress them, that the country gentlemen and farmers of\r\nGreat Britain so far forgot the generosity which is natural to their station,\r\nas to demand the exclusive privilege of supplying their countrymen with corn\r\nand butcher\u2019s meat. They did not, perhaps, take time to consider how much\r\nless their interest could be affected by the freedom of trade, than that of the\r\npeople whose example they followed.\r\n\n\r\nTo prohibit, by a perpetual law, the importation of foreign corn and cattle, is\r\nin reality to enact, that the population and industry of the country shall, at\r\nno time, exceed what the rude produce of its own soil can maintain.\r\n\n\r\nThere seem, however, to be two cases, in which it will generally be\r\nadvantageous to lay some burden upon foreign, for the encouragement of domestic\r\nindustry.\r\n\n\r\nThe first is, when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the\r\ndefence of the country. The defence of Great Britain, for example, depends very\r\nmuch upon the number of its sailors and shipping. The act of navigation,\r\ntherefore, very properly endeavours to give the sailors and shipping of Great\r\nBritain the monopoly of the trade of their own country, in some cases, by\r\nabsolute prohibitions, and in others, by heavy burdens upon the shipping of\r\nforeign countries. The following are the principal dispositions of this act.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, All ships, of which the owners, masters, and three-fourths of the\r\nmariners, are not British subjects, are prohibited, upon pain of forfeiting\r\nship and cargo, from trading to the British settlements and plantations, or\r\nfrom being employed in the coasting trade of Great Britain.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, A great variety of the most bulky articles of importation can be\r\nbrought into Great Britain only, either in such ships as are above described,\r\nor in ships of the country where those goods are produced, and of which the\r\nowners, masters, and three-fourths of the mariners, are of that particular\r\ncountry; and when imported even in ships of this latter kind, they are subject\r\nto double aliens duty. If imported in ships of any other country, the penalty\r\nis forfeiture of ship and goods. When this act was made, the Dutch were, what\r\nthey still are, the great carriers of Europe; and by this regulation they were\r\nentirely excluded from being the carriers to Great Britain, or from importing\r\nto us the goods of any other European country.\r\n\n\r\nThirdly, A great variety of the most bulky articles of importation are\r\nprohibited from being imported, even in British ships, from any country but\r\nthat in which they are produced, under pain of forfeiting ship and cargo. This\r\nregulation, too, was probably intended against the Dutch. Holland was then, as\r\nnow, the great emporium for all European goods; and by this regulation, British\r\nships were hindered from loading in Holland the goods of any other European\r\ncountry.\r\n\n\r\nFourthly, Salt fish of all kinds, whale fins, whalebone, oil, and blubber, not\r\ncaught by and cured on board British vessels, when imported into Great Britain,\r\nare subject to double aliens duty. The Dutch, as they are still the principal,\r\nwere then the only fishers in Europe that attempted to supply foreign nations\r\nwith fish. By this regulation, a very heavy burden was laid upon their\r\nsupplying Great Britain.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the act of navigation was made, though England and Holland were not\r\nactually at war, the most violent animosity subsisted between the two nations.\r\nIt had begun during the government of the long parliament, which first framed\r\nthis act, and it broke out soon after in the Dutch wars, during that of the\r\nProtector and of Charles II. It is not impossible, therefore, that some of the\r\nregulations of this famous act may have proceeded from national animosity. They\r\nare as wise, however, as if they had all been dictated by the most deliberate\r\nwisdom. National animosity, at that particular time, aimed at the very same\r\nobject which the most deliberate wisdom would have recommended, the diminution\r\nof the naval power of Holland, the only naval power which could endanger the\r\nsecurity of England.\r\n\n\r\nThe act of navigation is not favourable to foreign commerce, or to the growth\r\nof that opulence which can arise from it. The interest of a nation, in its\r\ncommercial relations to foreign nations, is, like that of a merchant with\r\nregard to the different people with whom he deals, to buy as cheap, and to sell\r\nas dear as possible. But it will be most likely to buy cheap, when, by the most\r\nperfect freedom of trade, it encourages all nations to bring to it the goods\r\nwhich it has occasion to purchase; and, for the same reason, it will be most\r\nlikely to sell dear, when its markets are thus filled with the greatest number\r\nof buyers. The act of navigation, it is true, lays no burden upon foreign ships\r\nthat come to export the produce of British industry. Even the ancient aliens\r\nduty, which used to be paid upon all goods, exported as well as imported, has,\r\nby several subsequent acts, been taken off from the greater part of the\r\narticles of exportation. But if foreigners, either by prohibitions or high\r\nduties, are hindered from coming to sell, they cannot always afford to come to\r\nbuy; because, coming without a cargo, they must lose the freight from their own\r\ncountry to Great Britain. By diminishing the number of sellers, therefore, we\r\nnecessarily diminish that of buyers, and are thus likely not only to buy\r\nforeign goods dearer, but to sell our own cheaper, than if there was a more\r\nperfect freedom of trade. As defence, however, is of much more importance than\r\nopulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps, the wisest of all the commercial\r\nregulations of England.\r\n\n\r\nThe second case, in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden\r\nupon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, is when some tax is\r\nimposed at home upon the produce of the latter. In this case, it seems\r\nreasonable that an equal tax should be imposed upon the like produce of the\r\nformer. This would not give the monopoly of the borne market to domestic\r\nindustry, nor turn towards a particular employment a greater share of the stock\r\nand labour of the country, than what would naturally go to it. It would only\r\nhinder any part of what would naturally go to it from being turned away by the\r\ntax into a less natural direction, and would leave the competition between\r\nforeign and domestic industry, after the tax, as nearly as possible upon the\r\nsame footing as before it. In Great Britain, when any such tax is laid upon the\r\nproduce of domestic industry, it is usual, at the same time, in order to stop\r\nthe clamorous complaints of our merchants and manufacturers, that they will be\r\nundersold at home, to lay a much heavier duty upon the importation of all\r\nforeign goods of the same kind.\r\n\n\r\nThis second limitation of the freedom of trade, according to some people,\r\nshould, upon most occasions, be extended much farther than to the precise\r\nforeign commodities which could come into competition with those which had been\r\ntaxed at home. When the necessaries of life have been taxed in any country, it\r\nbecomes proper, they pretend, to tax not only the like necessaries of life\r\nimported from other countries, but all sorts of foreign goods which can come\r\ninto competition with any thing that is the produce of domestic industry.\r\nSubsistence, they say, becomes necessarily dearer in consequence of such taxes;\r\nand the price of labour must always rise with the price of the labourer\u2019s\r\nsubsistence. Every commodity, therefore, which is the produce of domestic\r\nindustry, though not immediately taxed itself, becomes dearer in consequence of\r\nsuch taxes, because the labour which produces it becomes so. Such taxes,\r\ntherefore, are really equivalent, they say, to a tax upon every particular\r\ncommodity produced at home. In order to put domestic upon the same footing with\r\nforeign industry, therefore, it becomes necessary, they think, to lay some duty\r\nupon every foreign commodity, equal to this enhancement of the price of the\r\nhome commodities with which it can come into competition.\r\n\n\r\nWhether taxes upon the necessaries of life, such as those in Great Britain upon\r\nsoap, salt, leather, candles, etc. necessarily raise the price of labour, and\r\nconsequently that of all other commodities, I shall consider hereafter, when I\r\ncome to treat of taxes. Supposing, however, in the mean time, that they have\r\nthis effect, and they have it undoubtedly, this general enhancement of the\r\nprice of all commodities, in consequence of that labour, is a case which\r\ndiffers in the two following respects from that of a particular commodity, of\r\nwhich the price was enhanced by a particular tax immediately imposed upon it.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, It might always be known with great exactness, how far the price of such\r\na commodity could be enhanced by such a tax; but how far the general\r\nenhancement of the price of labour might affect that of every different\r\ncommodity about which labour was employed, could never be known with any\r\ntolerable exactness. It would be impossible, therefore, to proportion, with any\r\ntolerable exactness, the tax of every foreign, to the enhancement of the price\r\nof every home commodity.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, Taxes upon the necessaries of life have nearly the same effect upon\r\nthe circumstances of the people as a poor soil and a bad climate. Provisions\r\nare thereby rendered dearer, in the same manner as if it required extraordinary\r\nlabour and expense to raise them. As, in the natural scarcity arising from soil\r\nand climate, it would be absurd to direct the people in what manner they ought\r\nto employ their capitals and industry, so is it likewise in the artificial\r\nscarcity arising from such taxes. To be left to accommodate, as well as they\r\ncould, their industry to their situation, and to find out those employments in\r\nwhich, notwithstanding their unfavourable circumstances, they might have some\r\nadvantage either in the home or in the foreign market, is what, in both cases,\r\nwould evidently be most for their advantage. To lay a new-tax upon them,\r\nbecause they are already overburdened with taxes, and because they already pay\r\ntoo dear for the necessaries of life, to make them likewise pay too dear for\r\nthe greater part of other commodities, is certainly a most absurd way of making\r\namends.\r\n\n\r\nSuch taxes, when they have grown up to a certain height, are a curse equal to\r\nthe barrenness of the earth, and the inclemency of the heavens, and yet it is\r\nin the richest and most industrious countries that they have been most\r\ngenerally imposed. No other countries could support so great a disorder. As the\r\nstrongest bodies only can live and enjoy health under an unwholesome regimen,\r\nso the nations only, that in every sort of industry have the greatest natural\r\nand acquired advantages, can subsist and prosper under such taxes. Holland is\r\nthe country in Europe in which they abound most, and which, from peculiar\r\ncircumstances, continues to prosper, not by means of them, as has been most\r\nabsurdly supposed, but in spite of them.\r\n\n\r\nAs there are two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some\r\nburden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry, so there are\r\ntwo others in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, in the one,\r\nhow far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods;\r\nand, in the other, how far, or in what manner, it may be proper to restore that\r\nfree importation, after it has been for some time interrupted.\r\n\n\r\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how far it is\r\nproper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods, is when some\r\nforeign nation restrains, by high duties or prohibitions, the importation of\r\nsome of our manufactures into their country. Revenge, in this case, naturally\r\ndictates retaliation, and that we should impose the like duties and\r\nprohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufactures into\r\nours. Nations, accordingly, seldom fail to retaliate in this manner. The French\r\nhave been particularly forward to favour their own manufactures, by restraining\r\nthe importation of such foreign goods as could come into competition with them.\r\nIn this consisted a great part of the policy of Mr Colbert, who,\r\nnotwithstanding his great abilities, seems in this case to have been imposed\r\nupon by the sophistry of merchants and manufacturers, who are always demanding\r\na monopoly against their countrymen. It is at present the opinion of the most\r\nintelligent men in France, that his operations of this kind have not been\r\nbeneficial to his country. That minister, by the tariff of 1667, imposed very\r\nhigh duties upon a great number of foreign manufactures. Upon his refusing to\r\nmoderate them in favour of the Dutch, they, in 1671, prohibited the importation\r\nof the wines, brandies, and manufactures of France. The war of 1672 seems to\r\nhave been in part occasioned by this commercial dispute. The peace of Nimeguen\r\nput an end to it in 1678, by moderating some of those duties in favour of the\r\nDutch, who in consequence took off their prohibition. It was about the same\r\ntime that the French and English began mutually to oppress each other\u2019s\r\nindustry, by the like duties and prohibitions, of which the French, however,\r\nseem to have set the first example, The spirit of hostility which has subsisted\r\nbetween the two nations ever since, has hitherto hindered them from being\r\nmoderated on either side. In 1697, the Ehglish prohibited the importation of\r\nbone lace, the manufacture of Flanders. The government of that country, at that\r\ntime under the dominion of Spain, prohibited, in return, the importation of\r\nEnglish woollens. In 1700, the prohibition of importing bone lace into England\r\nwas taken oft; upon condition that the importation of English woollens into\r\nFlanders should be put on the same footing as before.\r\n\n\r\nThere may be good policy in retaliations of this kind, when there is a\r\nprobability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or\r\nprohibitions complained of. The recovery of a great foreign market will\r\ngenerally more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying dearer\r\nduring a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether such retaliations\r\nare likely to produce such an effect, does not, perhaps, belong so much to the\r\nscience of a legislator, whose deliberations ought to be governed by general\r\nprinciples, which are always the same, as to the skill of that insidious and\r\ncrafty animal vulgarly called a statesman or politician, whose councils are\r\ndirected by the momentary fluctuations of affairs. When there is no probability\r\nthat any such repeal can be procured, it seems a bad method of compensating the\r\ninjury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves,\r\nnot only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them. When\r\nour neighbours prohibit some manufacture of ours, we generally prohibit, not\r\nonly the same, for that alone would seldom affect them considerably, but some\r\nother manufacture of theirs. This may, no doubt, give encouragement to some\r\nparticular class of workmen among ourselves, and, by excluding some of their\r\nrivals, may enable them to raise their price in the home market. Those workmen\r\nhowever, who suffered by our neighbours prohibition, will not be benefited by\r\nours. On the contrary, they, and almost all the other classes of our citizens,\r\nwill thereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods. Every such\r\nlaw, therefore, imposes a real tax upon the whole country, not in favour of\r\nthat particular class of workmen who were injured by our neighbours\r\nprohibitions, but of some other class.\r\n\n\r\nThe case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation, how far, or in\r\nwhat manner, it is proper to restore the free importation of foreign goods,\r\nafter it has been for some time interrupted, is when particular manufactures,\r\nby means of high duties or prohibitions upon all foreign goods which can come\r\ninto competition with them, have been so far extended as to employ a great\r\nmultitude of hands. Humanity may in this case require that the freedom of trade\r\nshould be restored only by slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and\r\ncircumspection. Were those high duties and prohibitions taken away all at once,\r\ncheaper foreign goods of the same kind might be poured so fast into the home\r\nmarket, as to deprive all at once many thousands of our people of their\r\nordinary employment and means of subsistence. The disorder which this would\r\noccasion might no doubt be very considerable. It would in all probability,\r\nhowever, be much less than is commonly imagined, for the two following reasons.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, All those manufactures of which any part is commonly exported to other\r\nEuropean countries without a bounty, could be very little affected by the\r\nfreest importation of foreign goods. Such manufactures must be sold as cheap\r\nabroad as any other foreign goods of the same quality and kind, and\r\nconsequently must be sold cheaper at home. They would still, therefore, keep\r\npossession of the home market; and though a capricious man of fashion might\r\nsometimes prefer foreign wares, merely because they were foreign, to cheaper\r\nand better goods of the same kind that were made at home, this folly could,\r\nfrom the nature of things, extend to so few, that it could make no sensible\r\nimpression upon the general employment of the people. But a great part of all\r\nthe different branches of our woollen manufacture, of our tanned leather, and\r\nof our hardware, are annually exported to other European countries without any\r\nbounty, and these are the manufactures which employ the greatest number of\r\nhands. The silk, perhaps, is the manufacture which would suffer the most by\r\nthis freedom of trade, and after it the linen, though the latter much less than\r\nthe former.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, Though a great number of people should, by thus restoring the freedom\r\nof trade, be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employment and common\r\nmethod of subsistence, it would by no means follow that they would thereby be\r\ndeprived either of employment or subsistence. By the reduction of the army and\r\nnavy at the end of the late war, more than 100,000 soldiers and seamen, a\r\nnumber equal to what is employed in the greatest manufactures, were all at once\r\nthrown out of their ordinary employment: but though they no doubt suffered some\r\ninconveniency, they were not thereby deprived of all employment and\r\nsubsistence. The greater part of the seamen, it is probable, gradually betook\r\nthemselves to the merchant service as they could find occasion, and in the mean\r\ntime both they and the soldiers were absorbed in the great mass of the people,\r\nand employed in a great variety of occupations. Not only no great convulsion,\r\nbut no sensible disorder, arose from so great a change in the situation of more\r\nthan 100,000 men, all accustomed to the use of arms, and many of them to rapine\r\nand plunder. The number of vagrants was scarce anywhere sensibly increased by\r\nit; even the wages of labour were not reduced by it in any occupation, so far\r\nas I have been able to learn, except in that of seamen in the merchant service.\r\nBut if we compare together the habits of a soldier and of any sort of\r\nmanufacturer, we shall find that those of the latter do not tend so much to\r\ndisqualify him from being employed in a new trade, as those of the former from\r\nbeing employed in any. The manufacturer has always been accustomed to look for\r\nhis subsistence from his labour only; the soldier to expect it from his pay.\r\nApplication and industry have been familiar to the one; idleness and\r\ndissipation to the other. But it is surely much easier to change the direction\r\nof industry from one sort of labour to another, than to turn idleness and\r\ndissipation to any. To the greater part of manufactures, besides, it has\r\nalready been observed, there are other collateral manufactures of so similar a\r\nnature, that a workman can easily transfer his industry from one of them to\r\nanother. The greater part of such workmen, too, are occasionally employed in\r\ncountry labour. The stock which employed them in a particular manufacture\r\nbefore, will still remain in the country, to employ an equal number of people\r\nin some other way. The capital of the country remaining the same, the demand\r\nfor labour will likewise be the same, or very nearly the same, though it may be\r\nexerted in different places, and for different occupations. Soldiers and\r\nseamen, indeed, when discharged from the king\u2019s service, are at liberty\r\nto exercise any trade within any town or place of Great Britain or Ireland. Let\r\nthe same natural liberty of exercising what species of industry they please, be\r\nrestored to all his Majesty\u2019s subjects, in the same manner as to soldiers\r\nand seamen; that is, break down the exclusive privileges of corporations, and\r\nrepeal the statute of apprenticeship, both which are really encroachments upon\r\nnatural Liberty, and add to those the repeal of the law of settlements, so that\r\na poor workman, when thrown out of employment, either in one trade or in one\r\nplace, may seek for it in another trade or in another place, without the fear\r\neither of a prosecution or of a removal; and neither the public nor the\r\nindividuals will suffer much more from the occasional disbanding some\r\nparticular classes of manufacturers, than from that of the soldiers. Our\r\nmanufacturers have no doubt great merit with their country, but they cannot\r\nhave more than those who defend it with their blood, nor deserve to be treated\r\nwith more delicacy.\r\n\n\r\nTo expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored\r\nin Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should\r\never be established in it. Not only the prejudices of the public, but, what is\r\nmuch more unconquerable, the private interests of many individuals,\r\nirresistibly oppose it. Were the officers of the army to oppose, with the same\r\nzeal and unanimity, any reduction in the number of forces, with which master\r\nmanufacturers set themselves against every law that is likely to increase the\r\nnumber of their rivals in the home market; were the former to animate their\r\nsoldiers. In the same manner as the latter inflame their workmen, to attack\r\nwith violence and outrage the proposers of any such regulation; to attempt to\r\nreduce the army would be as dangerous as it has now become to attempt to\r\ndiminish, in any respect, the monopoly which our manufacturers have obtained\r\nagainst us. This monopoly has so much increased the number of some particular\r\ntribes of them, that, like an overgrown standing army, they have become\r\nformidable to the government, and, upon many occasions, intimidate the\r\nlegislature. The member of parliament who supports every proposal for\r\nstrengthening this monopoly, is sure to acquire not only the reputation of\r\nunderstanding trade, but great popularity and influence with an order of men\r\nwhose numbers and wealth render them of great importance. If he opposes them,\r\non the contrary, and still more, if he has authority enough to be able to\r\nthwart them, neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank, nor\r\nthe greatest public services, can protect him from the most infamous abuse and\r\ndetraction, from personal insults, nor sometimes from real danger, arising from\r\nthe insolent outrage of furious and disappointed monopolists.\r\n\n\r\nThe undertaker of a great manufacture, who, by the home markets being suddenly\r\nlaid open to the competition of foreigners, should be obliged to abandon his\r\ntrade, would no doubt suffer very considerably. That part of his capital which\r\nhad usually been employed in purchasing materials, and in paying his workmen,\r\nmight, without much difficulty, perhaps, find another employment; but that part\r\nof it which was fixed in workhouses, and in the instruments of trade, could\r\nscarce be disposed of without considerable loss. The equitable regard,\r\ntherefore, to his interest, requires that changes of this kind should never be\r\nintroduced suddenly, but slowly, gradually, and after a very long warning. The\r\nlegislature, were it possible that its deliberations could be always directed,\r\nnot by the clamorous importunity of partial interests, but by an extensive view\r\nof the general good, ought, upon this very account, perhaps, to be particularly\r\ncareful, neither to establish any new monopolies of this kind, nor to extend\r\nfurther those which are already established. Every such regulation introduces\r\nsome degree of real disorder into the constitution of the state, which it will\r\nbe difficult afterwards to cure without occasioning another disorder.\r\n\n\r\nHow far it may be proper to impose taxes upon the importation of foreign goods,\r\nin order not to prevent their importation, but to raise a revenue for\r\ngovernment, I shall consider hereafter when I come to treat of taxes. Taxes\r\nimposed with a view to prevent, or even to diminish importation, are evidently\r\nas destructive of the revenue of the customs as of the freedom of trade.\r\n\n\r\nTo lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all\r\nkinds, from those particular countries with which the balance of trade is\r\nsupposed to be disadvantageous, is the second expedient by which the commercial\r\nsystem proposes to increase the quantity of gold and silver. Thus, in Great\r\nBritain, Silesia lawns may be imported for home consumption, upon paying\r\ncertain duties; but French cambrics and lawns are prohibited to be imported,\r\nexcept into the port of London, there to be warehoused for exportation. Higher\r\nduties are imposed upon the wines of France than upon those of Portugal, or\r\nindeed of any other country. By what is called the impost 1692, a duty of five\r\nand-twenty per cent. of the rate or value, was laid upon all French goods;\r\nwhile the goods of other nations were, the greater part of them, subjected to\r\nmuch lighter duties, seldom exceeding five per cent. The wine, brandy, salt,\r\nand vinegar of France, were indeed excepted; these commodities being subjected\r\nto other heavy duties, either by other laws, or by particular clauses of the\r\nsame law. In 1696, a second duty of twenty-five per cent. the first not having\r\nbeen thought a sufficient discouragement, was imposed upon all French goods,\r\nexcept brandy; together with a new duty of five-and-twenty pounds upon the ton\r\nof French wine, and another of fifteen pounds upon the ton of French vinegar.\r\nFrench goods have never been omitted in any of those general subsidies or\r\nduties of five per cent. which have been imposed upon all, or the greater part,\r\nof the goods enumerated in the book of rates. If we count the one-third and\r\ntwo-third subsidies as making a complete subsidy between them, there have been\r\nfive of these general subsidies; so that, before the commencement of the\r\npresent war, seventy-five per cent. may be considered as the lowest duty to\r\nwhich the greater part of the goods of the growth, produce, or manufacture of\r\nFrance, were liable. But upon the greater part of goods, those duties are\r\nequivalent to a prohibition. The French, in their turn, have, I believe,\r\ntreated our goods and manufactures just as hardly; though I am not so well\r\nacquainted with the particular hardships which they have imposed upon them.\r\nThose mutual restraints have put an end to almost all fair commerce between the\r\ntwo nations; and smugglers are now the principal importers, either of British\r\ngoods into France, or of French goods into Great Britain. The principles which\r\nI have been examining, in the foregoing chapter, took their origin from private\r\ninterest and the spirit of monopoly; those which I am going te examine in this,\r\nfrom national prejudice and animosity. They are, accordingly, as might well be\r\nexpected, still more unreasonable. They are so, even upon the principles of the\r\ncommercial system.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, Though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between France\r\nand England, for example, the balance would be in favour of France, it would by\r\nno means follow that such a trade would be disadvantageous to England, or that\r\nthe general balance of its whole trade would thereby be turned more against it.\r\nIf the wines of France are better and cheaper than those of Portugal, or its\r\nlinens than those of Germany, it would be more advantageous for Great Britain\r\nto purchase both the wine and the foreign linen which it had occasion for of\r\nFrance, than of Portugal and Germany. Though the value of the annual\r\nimportations from France would thereby be greatly augmented, the value of the\r\nwhole annual importations would be diminished, in proportion as the French\r\ngoods of the same quality were cheaper than those of the other two countries.\r\nThis would be the case, even upon the supposition that the whole French goods\r\nimported were to be consumed in Great Britain.\r\n\n\r\nBut, Secondly, A great part of them might be re-exported to other countries,\r\nwhere, being sold with profit, they might bring back a return, equal in value,\r\nperhaps, to the prime cost of the whole French goods imported. What has\r\nfrequently been said of the East India trade, might possibly be true of the\r\nFrench; that though the greater part of East India goods were bought with gold\r\nand silver, the re-exportation of a part of them to other countries brought\r\nback more gold and silver to that which carried on the trade, than the prime\r\ncost of the whole amounted to. One of the most important branches of the Dutch\r\ntrade at present, consists in the carriage of French goods to other European\r\ncountries. Some part even of the French wine drank in Great Britain, is\r\nclandestinely imported from Holland and Zealand. If there was either a free\r\ntrade between France and England, or if French goods could be imported upon\r\npaying only the same duties as those of other European nations, to be drawn\r\nback upon exportation, England might have some share of a trade which is found\r\nso advantageous to Holland.\r\n\n\r\nThirdly, and lastly, There is no certain criterion by which we can determine on\r\nwhich side what is called the balance between any two countries lies, or which\r\nof them exports to the greatest value. National prejudice and animosity,\r\nprompted always by the private interest of particular traders, are the\r\nprinciples which generally direct our judgment upon all questions concerning\r\nit. There are two criterions, however, which have frequently been appealed to\r\nupon such occasions, the custom-house books and the course of exchange. The\r\ncustom-house books, I think, it is now generally acknowledged, are a very\r\nuncertain criterion, on account of the inaccuracy of the valuation at which the\r\ngreater part of goods are rated in them. The course of exchange is, perhaps,\r\nalmost equally so.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the exchange between two places, such as London and Paris, is at par, it\r\nis said to be a sign that the debts due from London to Paris are compensated by\r\nthose due from Paris to London. On the contrary, when a premium is paid at\r\nLondon for a bill upon Paris, it is said to be a sign that the debts due from\r\nLondon to Paris are not compensated by those due from Paris to London, but that\r\na balance in money must be sent out from the latter place; for the risk,\r\ntrouble, and expense, of exporting which, the premium is both demanded and\r\ngiven. But the ordinary state of debt and credit between those two cities must\r\nnecessarily be regulated, it is said, by the ordinary course of their dealings\r\nwith one another. When neither of them imports from from other to a greater\r\namount than it exports to that other, the debts and credits of each may\r\ncompensate one another. But when one of them imports from the other to a\r\ngreater value than it exports to that other, the former necessarily becomes\r\nindebted to the latter in a greater sum than the latter becomes indebted to it:\r\nthe debts and credits of each do not compensate one another, and money must be\r\nsent out from that place of which the debts overbalance the credits. The\r\nordinary course of exchange, therefore, being an indication of the ordinary\r\nstate of debt and credit between two places, must likewise be an indication of\r\nthe ordinary course of their exports and imports, as these necessarily regulate\r\nthat state", "summary": "\nThis text examines how the mercantilist idea that wealth consists primarily of gold and silver shaped trade policies. Despite acknowledging this notion's limitations, many writers reverted to it in their arguments, treating the accumulation of precious metals as the ultimate economic goal. This belief led governments to implement policies aimed at achieving favorable trade balances through restricting imports and encouraging exports.\nThe mercantilist system employed various restrictions on imports, including high duties and outright prohibitions on foreign goods that could be produced domestically. This created monopolies for domestic industries in their home markets. Simultaneously, exports were encouraged through drawbacks (duty refunds), bounties (subsidies), advantageous commercial treaties, and colonial establishments that provided privileged market access.\nThe author argues that such trade restrictions are generally harmful, as they divert capital from its natural course. The general industry of society cannot exceed what its capital can employ, and regulations merely redirect capital rather than increasing it. Individual entrepreneurs, pursuing their self-interest, naturally allocate capital to its most productive uses. This pursuit of private gain leads individuals, as if guided by an \"invisible hand,\" to promote societal welfare more effectively than when they explicitly intend to do so.\nProtectionist policies essentially direct private citizens how to employ their capital, which the author considers generally harmful. Drawing an analogy to household management, he argues that just as a family shouldn't make products it can purchase more cheaply, a nation shouldn't manufacture what it can import at lower cost. The general industry of a country depends on its total capital, and protective policies merely divert this capital to less advantageous employments, diminishing the total value of national production.\nThe author acknowledges two exceptions where trade restrictions might be justified: for national defense (as with Britain's Navigation Acts protecting its shipping industry), and to counterbalance domestic taxes on industry. He also discusses retaliatory trade restrictions against countries that impose barriers to one's exports, but cautions that such measures benefit neither nation overall.\nWhen dismantling long-standing protections, the author recommends gradual liberalization to avoid sudden unemployment. He observes that many workers could shift to related industries, as happened when soldiers and sailors were demobilized after war without causing significant disruption. However, he acknowledges that powerful manufacturing interests typically oppose free trade reforms.\nFinally, the author questions how to determine which nation has a favorable balance of trade, noting that customs records and exchange rates are unreliable indicators. Exchange rates presumably reflect the balance of debts between nations, but these can be influenced by many factors beyond the value of goods traded.\n", "map": [["Mercantilist ideology", "Gold and silver accumulation"], ["Government policy", "Favorable trade balance pursuit"], ["Import restrictions", "Domestic industry monopolies"], ["Export encouragement", "Drawbacks, bounties, and commercial treaties"], ["Trade restrictions", "Capital diversion from natural course"], ["Societal industry limit", "Available capital amount"], ["Self-interest pursuit", "Optimal capital allocation"], ["Invisible hand", "Unintended societal welfare promotion"], ["Protectionist policies", "Government direction of capital"], ["Household management analogy", "Import versus domestic production"], ["Trade restrictions", "Value of national production diminished"], ["National defense exception", "Navigation Acts justification"], ["Domestic tax counterbalance", "Import restriction justification"], ["Retaliatory trade measures", "Mutual disadvantage outcome"], ["Gradual liberalization", "Sudden unemployment prevention"], ["Manufacturing interests", "Free trade reform opposition"], ["Trade balance determination", "Unreliable measurement indicators"]]}
