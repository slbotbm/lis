Our interview was short.\r\nWhen I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with\r\nhis elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen\r\ndiscontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a\r\nmeasure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. \u201cDon\u2019t\r\nyou know me?\u201d I asked. His answer was not reassuring: \u201cI know you well\r\nenough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself\r\nand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed\r\nDutchmen!\u201d Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable\r\nsullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at\r\nall. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so\r\nclever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few\r\nhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does\r\nrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be\r\nworried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it\r\nis better so.\u201d\n\u201cI agree with you with all my heart,\u201d I answered earnestly, for I did\r\nnot want him to weaken in this matter. \u201cMrs. Harker is better out of it.\r\nThings are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have\r\nbeen in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,\r\nand if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time\r\ninfallibly have wrecked her.\u201d\nSo Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey\r\nand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I\r\nshall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.\nMina Harker\u2019s Journal.\n1 October.\u2014It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;\r\nafter Jonathan\u2019s full confidence for so many years, to see him\r\nmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This\r\nmorning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though\r\nJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went\r\nout, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of\r\nwhat had happened in the visit to the Count\u2019s house. And yet he must\r\nhave known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it\r\nmust have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that\r\nit was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and\r\nI acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am\r\ncrying like a silly fool, when I know it comes from my husband\u2019s great\r\nlove and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.\nThat has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and\r\nlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept\r\nanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has\r\nfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my\r\nheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and\r\nlow-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible\r\nexcitement.\nLast night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told\r\nme to. I didn\u2019t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I\r\nkept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to\r\nsee me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate\r\npressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does\r\nseems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which\r\nis most to be deplored. If I hadn\u2019t gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear\r\nLucy would be with us now. She hadn\u2019t taken to visiting the churchyard\r\ntill I came, and if she hadn\u2019t come there in the day-time with me she\r\nwouldn\u2019t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn\u2019t gone there at\r\nnight and asleep, that monster couldn\u2019t have destroyed her as he did.\r\nOh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what\r\nhas come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew\r\nthat I had been crying twice in one morning\u2014I, who never cried on my\r\nown account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear\u2014the dear\r\nfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do\r\nfeel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons\r\nthat we poor women have to learn....\nI can\u2019t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing\r\nthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying\r\non a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield\u2019s room, which is somewhere\r\nunder this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so\r\nprofound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.\r\nAll was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight\r\nseeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be\r\nstirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin\r\nstreak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness\r\nacross the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a\r\nvitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must\r\nhave done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy\r\ncreeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out\r\nand looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now\r\nclose up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the\r\nwall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was\r\nmore loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,\r\nI could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on\r\nhis part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\r\nattendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into\r\nbed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.\r\nI was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have\r\nfallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the\r\nmorning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a\r\nlittle time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\r\nbending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of\r\nthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.\nI thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I\r\nwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my\r\nhands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the\r\nusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn\r\nupon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the\r\nclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim\r\naround. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\r\ncame only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\r\ngrown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I\r\nhad shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to\r\nmake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\r\nlimbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed\r\nmy eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what\r\ntricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The\r\nmist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I\r\ncould see it like smoke\u2014or with the white energy of boiling\r\nwater\u2014pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of\r\nthe door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\r\nconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top\r\nof which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things\r\nbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\r\nwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \u201ca\r\npillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\u201d Was it indeed some such\r\nspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was\r\ncomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\r\nred eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I\r\nlooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like\r\ntwo red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering\r\nwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary\u2019s\r\nChurch. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan\r\nhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist\r\nin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became\r\nblack darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to\r\nshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be\r\ncareful of such dreams, for they would unseat one\u2019s reason if there were\r\ntoo much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe\r\nsomething for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm\r\nthem. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their\r\nfears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do\r\nnot, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that\r\ncannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night\u2019s sleep. Last\r\nnight tired me more than if I had not slept at all.\n\u00a0\n2 October 10 p. m.\u2014Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have\r\nslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the\r\nsleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and\r\nspiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was\r\nvery gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless\r\nme. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This\r\nis a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be\r\nmiserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till\r\ndinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten\r\nthem up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how\r\ntired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke\r\ntogether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other\r\nof what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan\u2019s\r\nmanner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so\r\nsleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to\r\ngive me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night\r\nbefore. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to\r\nme, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I\r\nhave taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope\r\nI have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear\r\ncomes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the\r\npower of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.\n1 October, evening.\u2014I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal\r\nGreen, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The\r\nvery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had\r\nproved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I\r\nlearned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he\r\nwas only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the\r\nresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph\r\nSmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a\r\nsaucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable\r\ntype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all\r\nabout the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog\u2019s-eared\r\nnotebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the\r\nseat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,\r\nhalf-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There\r\nwere, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at\r\n197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he\r\ndeposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to\r\nscatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were\r\nchosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more\r\nfully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that\r\nhe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now\r\nfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern\r\nshore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to\r\nbe left out of his diabolical scheme\u2014let alone the City itself and the\r\nvery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back\r\nto Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had\r\nbeen taken from Carfax.\nHe replied:\u2014\n\u201cWell, guv\u2019nor, you\u2019ve treated me wery \u2019an\u2019some\u201d\u2014I had given him half a\r\nsovereign\u2014\u201can\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of\r\nBloxam say four nights ago in the \u2019Are an\u2019 \u2019Ounds, in Pincher\u2019s Alley,\r\nas \u2019ow he an\u2019 his mate \u2019ad \u2019ad a rare dusty job in a old \u2019ouse at\r\nPurfect. There ain\u2019t a-many such jobs as this \u2019ere, an\u2019 I\u2019m thinkin\u2019\r\nthat maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.\u201d I asked if he could tell me\r\nwhere to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it\r\nwould be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest\r\nof his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search\r\nthen and there. At the door he stopped, and said:\u2014\n\u201cLook \u2019ere, guv\u2019nor, there ain\u2019t no sense in me a-keepin\u2019 you \u2019ere. I\r\nmay find Sam soon, or I mayn\u2019t; but anyhow he ain\u2019t like to be in a way\r\nto tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.\r\nIf you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on\r\nit, I\u2019ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But\r\nye\u2019d better be up arter \u2019im soon in the mornin\u2019, or maybe ye won\u2019t ketch\r\n\u2019im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.\u201d\nThis was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to\r\nbuy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she\r\ncame back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had\r\nagain faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way\r\nto home. We\u2019re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.\r\nMina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as\r\nthough she had been crying. Poor dear, I\u2019ve no doubt it frets her to be\r\nkept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the\r\nothers. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and\r\nworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors\r\nwere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful\r\nbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence\r\nmust rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any\r\ncircumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she\r\nherself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the\r\nCount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.\n\u00a0\n2 October, evening.\u2014A long and trying and exciting day. By the first\r\npost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on\r\nwhich was written with a carpenter\u2019s pencil in a sprawling hand:\u2014\n\u201cSam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for\r\nthe depite.\u201d\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy\r\nand sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,\r\nbut that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for\r\nher going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,\r\nwith her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and\r\nin ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I\r\nwas off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should\r\nhave found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some\r\ndifficulty, Potter\u2019s Court. Mr. Smollet\u2019s spelling misled me, as I asked\r\nfor Poter\u2019s Court instead of Potter\u2019s Court. However, when I had found\r\nthe court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran\u2019s lodging-house.\r\nWhen I asked the man who came to the door for the \u201cdepite,\u201d he shook his\r\nhead, and said: \u201cI dunno \u2019im. There ain\u2019t no such a person \u2019ere; I never\r\n\u2019eard of \u2019im in all my bloomin\u2019 days. Don\u2019t believe there ain\u2019t nobody\r\nof that kind livin\u2019 ere or anywheres.\u201d I took out Smollet\u2019s letter, and\r\nas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name\r\nof the court might guide me. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI\u2019m the depity,\u201d he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right\r\ntrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the\r\ndeputy\u2019s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who\r\nhad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\r\nCorcoran\u2019s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o\u2019clock that\r\nmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\r\nhe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \u201cnew-fangled ware\u2019us\u201d;\r\nand with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve\r\no\u2019clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\r\nI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One\r\nof these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a\r\nnew \u201ccold storage\u201d building; and as this suited the condition of a\r\n\u201cnew-fangled ware\u2019us,\u201d I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly\r\ngatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the\r\ncoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\r\nsuggesting that I was willing to pay his day\u2019s wages to his foreman for\r\nthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was\r\na smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had\r\npromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\r\nthat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\r\nand had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes\u2014\u201cmain\r\nheavy ones\u201d\u2014with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I\r\nasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\r\nwhich he replied:\u2014\n\u201cWell, guv\u2019nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a\r\nbig white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a\r\ndusty old \u2019ouse, too, though nothin\u2019 to the dustiness of the \u2019ouse we\r\ntooked the bloomin\u2019 boxes from.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get into the houses if they were both empty?\u201d\n\u201cThere was the old party what engaged me a-waitin\u2019 in the \u2019ouse at\r\nPurfleet. He \u2019elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse\r\nme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an\u2019 him a old feller,\r\nwith a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn\u2019t throw\r\na shadder.\u201d\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!\n\u201cWhy, \u2019e took up \u2019is end o\u2019 the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\r\nme a-puffin\u2019 an\u2019 a-blowin\u2019 afore I could up-end mine anyhow\u2014an\u2019 I\u2019m no\r\nchicken, neither.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cHe was there too. He must \u2019a\u2019 started off and got there afore me, for\r\nwhen I rung of the bell he kem an\u2019 opened the door \u2019isself an\u2019 \u2019elped me\r\nto carry the boxes into the \u2019all.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole nine?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cYus; there was five in the first load an\u2019 four in the second. It was\r\nmain dry work, an\u2019 I don\u2019t so well remember \u2019ow I got \u2019ome.\u201d I\r\ninterrupted him:\u2014\n\u201cWere the boxes left in the hall?\u201d\n\u201cYus; it was a big \u2019all, an\u2019 there was nothin\u2019 else in it.\u201d I made one\r\nmore attempt to further matters:\u2014\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any key?\u201d\n\u201cNever used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door \u2019isself\r\nan\u2019 shut it again when I druv off. I don\u2019t remember the last time\u2014but\r\nthat was the beer.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t remember the number of the house?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir. But ye needn\u2019t have no difficulty about that. It\u2019s a \u2019igh \u2019un\r\nwith a stone front with a bow on it, an\u2019 \u2019igh steps up to the door. I\r\nknow them steps, \u2019avin\u2019 \u2019ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\r\nwhat come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin\u2019s, an\u2019\r\nthey seein\u2019 they got so much, they wanted more; but \u2019e took one of them\r\nby the shoulder and was like to throw \u2019im down the steps, till the lot\r\nof them went away cussin\u2019.\u201d I thought that with this description I could\r\nfind the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started\r\noff for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count\r\ncould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was\r\nprecious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of\r\ndistribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task\r\nunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked\r\nwestward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house\r\ndescribed, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs\r\narranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long\r\nuntenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\r\nup. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint\r\nhad mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been\r\na large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been\r\nroughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.\r\nBehind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,\r\nwhose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have\r\nbeen able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have\r\ngiven some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my\r\nexperience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not\r\nbut feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means\r\ndiscovered of gaining access to the house.\nThere was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and\r\nnothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything\r\ncould be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the\r\nPiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the\r\ngrooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything\r\nabout the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been\r\ntaken, but he couldn\u2019t say from whom. He told me, however, that up to\r\nvery lately there had been a notice-board of \u201cFor Sale\u201d up, and that\r\nperhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me\r\nsomething, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on\r\nthe board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know\r\nor guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\r\naway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I\r\ndid not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &\r\nCandy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\r\nSackville Street.\nThe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\r\nuncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the\r\nPiccadilly house\u2014which throughout our interview he called a\r\n\u201cmansion\u201d\u2014was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I\r\nasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\r\npaused a few seconds before replying:\u2014\n\u201cIt is sold, sir.\u201d\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d I said, with equal politeness, \u201cbut I have a special reason\r\nfor wishing to know who purchased it.\u201d\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. \u201cIt is sold,\r\nsir,\u201d was again his laconic reply.\n\u201cSurely,\u201d I said, \u201cyou do not mind letting me know so much.\u201d\n\u201cBut I do mind,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe affairs of their clients are\r\nabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.\u201d This was\r\nmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\r\nhim. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:\u2014\n\u201cYour clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\r\nconfidence. I am myself a professional man.\u201d Here I handed him my card.\r\n\u201cIn this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\r\nLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\r\nhe understood, lately for sale.\u201d These words put a different complexion\r\non affairs. He said:\u2014\n\u201cI would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would\r\nI like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of\r\nrenting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\r\nHolmwood. If you will let me have his lordship\u2019s address I will consult\r\nthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\r\nlordship by to-night\u2019s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far\r\ndeviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\r\nlordship.\u201d\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\r\ngave the address at Dr. Seward\u2019s and came away. It was now dark, and I\r\nwas tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the A\u00ebrated Bread Company\r\nand came down to Purfleet by the next train.\nI found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she\r\nmade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to\r\nthink that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\r\ninquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at\r\nour conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\r\nconfidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\r\nkeeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or\r\nelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\r\nany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we\r\nmade our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\r\nknowledge would be torture to her.\nI could not tell the others of the day\u2019s discovery till we were alone;\r\nso after dinner\u2014followed by a little music to save appearances even\r\namongst ourselves\u2014I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.\r\nThe dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me\r\nas though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I\r\ncame away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\r\ndifference between us.\nWhen I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\r\nthe study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\r\nit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\r\ninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:\u2014\n\u201cThis has been a great day\u2019s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on\r\nthe track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then\r\nour work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search\r\nuntil we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the\r\nwretch to his real death.\u201d We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.\r\nMorris spoke:\u2014\n\u201cSay! how are we going to get into that house?\u201d\n\u201cWe got into the other,\u201d answered Lord Godalming quickly.\n\u201cBut, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\r\nand a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to\r\ncommit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don\u2019t\r\nsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key\r\nof some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the\r\nmorning.\u201d Lord Godalming\u2019s brows contracted, and he stood up and walked\r\nabout the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to\r\nanother of us:\u2014\n\u201cQuincey\u2019s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we\r\ngot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand\u2014unless we\r\ncan find the Count\u2019s key basket.\u201d\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\r\nleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell\u2019s,\r\nwe decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good\r\nwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\r\nbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\r\nmoment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\nJust a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her\r\nforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\r\nin her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\r\ndid this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\r\nherself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n1 October.\u2014I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so\r\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\r\nalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\r\nthan interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his\r\nrepulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.\r\nHe was, in fact, commanding destiny\u2014subjectively. He did not really\r\ncare for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and\r\nlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I\r\nthought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\r\nhim:\u2014\n\u201cWhat about the flies these times?\u201d He smiled on me in quite a superior\r\nsort of way\u2014such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio\u2014as\r\nhe answered me:\u2014\n\u201cThe fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical\r\nof the a\u00ebrial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well\r\nwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!\u201d\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\r\nquickly:\u2014\n\u201cOh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\u201d His madness foiled his\r\nreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\r\nwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:\u2014\n\u201cOh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.\u201d Here he brightened\r\nup; \u201cI am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I\r\nhave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\r\nstudy zo\u00f6phagy!\u201d\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:\u2014\n\u201cThen you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\u201d He smiled with an\r\nineffably benign superiority.\n\u201cOh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the\r\nDeity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I\r\nmay state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\r\npurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\r\nspiritually!\u201d This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall\r\nEnoch\u2019s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\r\nthat by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:\u2014\n\u201cAnd why with Enoch?\u201d\n\u201cBecause he walked with God.\u201d I could not see the analogy, but did not\r\nlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:\u2014\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t care about life and you don\u2019t want souls. Why not?\u201d I put\r\nmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.\r\nThe effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his\r\nold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as\r\nhe replied:\u2014\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t use them if\r\nI had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn\u2019t eat them\r\nor\u2014\u2014\u201d He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his\r\nface, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. \u201cAnd doctor, as to\r\nlife, what is it after all? When you\u2019ve got all you require, and you\r\nknow that you will never want, that is all. I have friends\u2014good\r\nfriends\u2014like you, Dr. Seward\u201d; this was said with a leer of\r\ninexpressible cunning. \u201cI know that I shall never lack the means of\r\nlife!\u201d\nI think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some\r\nantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as\r\nhe\u2014a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it\r\nwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.\nLater in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come\r\nwithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him\r\nthat I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything\r\nto help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are\r\nLord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the\r\nrecord prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate\r\nknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish\r\nto be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with\r\nme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\r\nmight not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield\r\nmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\r\nalone.\nI found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\r\nwhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I\r\ncame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\r\nlips:\u2014\n\u201cWhat about souls?\u201d It was evident then that my surmise had been\r\ncorrect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the\r\nlunatic. I determined to have the matter out. \u201cWhat about them\r\nyourself?\u201d I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round\r\nhim, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for\r\nan answer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any souls!\u201d he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The\r\nmatter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it\u2014to \u201cbe\r\ncruel only to be kind.\u201d So I said:\u2014\n\u201cYou like life, and you want life?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes! but that is all right; you needn\u2019t worry about that!\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d I asked, \u201chow are we to get the life without getting the soul\r\nalso?\u201d This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:\u2014\n\u201cA nice time you\u2019ll have some time when you\u2019re flying out there, with\r\nthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing\r\nand twittering and miauing all round you. You\u2019ve got their lives, you\r\nknow, and you must put up with their souls!\u201d Something seemed to affect\r\nhis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\r\nscrewing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\r\nsoaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\r\nme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child\u2014only a child,\r\nthough the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It\r\nwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\r\nand, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\r\nto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\r\ngo with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,\r\nspeaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:\u2014\n\u201cWould you like some sugar to get your flies round again?\u201d He seemed to\r\nwake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:\u2014\n\u201cNot much! flies are poor things, after all!\u201d After a pause he added,\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\u201d\n\u201cOr spiders?\u201d I went on.\n\u201cBlow spiders! What\u2019s the use of spiders? There isn\u2019t anything in them\r\nto eat or\u201d\u2014he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\r\ntopic.\n\u201cSo, so!\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cthis is the second time he has suddenly\r\nstopped at the word \u2018drink\u2019; what does it mean?\u201d Renfield seemed himself\r\naware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract\r\nmy attention from it:\u2014\n\u201cI don\u2019t take any stock at all in such matters. \u2018Rats and mice and such\r\nsmall deer,\u2019 as Shakespeare has it, \u2018chicken-feed of the larder\u2019 they\r\nmight be called. I\u2019m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well\r\nask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to\r\ninterest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before\r\nme.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want big things that you can make your teeth meet\r\nin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?\u201d\n\u201cWhat ridiculous nonsense you are talking!\u201d He was getting too wide\r\nawake, so I thought I would press him hard. \u201cI wonder,\u201d I said\r\nreflectively, \u201cwhat an elephant\u2019s soul is like!\u201d\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\r\nhigh-horse and became a child again.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an elephant\u2019s soul, or any soul at all!\u201d he said. For a\r\nfew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\r\nhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \u201cTo\r\nhell with you and your souls!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhy do you plague me about\r\nsouls? Haven\u2019t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\r\nwithout thinking of souls!\u201d He looked so hostile that I thought he was\r\nin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,\r\nhowever, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:\u2014\n\u201cForgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so\r\nworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the\r\nproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and\r\ntolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I\r\nwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am\r\nsure you will understand!\u201d He had evidently self-control; so when the\r\nattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield\r\nwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\r\ndignity and sweetness:\u2014\n\u201cDr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that\r\nI am very, very grateful to you!\u201d I thought it well to leave him in this\r\nmood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in\r\nthis man\u2019s state. Several points seem to make what the American\r\ninterviewer calls \u201ca story,\u201d if one could only get them in proper order.\r\nHere they are:\u2014\nWill not mention \u201cdrinking.\u201d\nFears the thought of being burdened with the \u201csoul\u201d of anything.\nHas no dread of wanting \u201clife\u201d in the future.\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being\r\nhaunted by their souls.\nLogically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind\r\nthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence\u2014the\r\nburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!\nAnd the assurance\u2014?\nMerciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of\r\nterror afoot!\n\u00a0\nLater.\u2014I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my\r\nsuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a\r\nwhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door\r\nwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time\r\nwhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that\r\nhe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the\r\nautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk\r\nof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He\r\nwent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had\r\ngot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come\r\naway as ignorant as we went in.\nHis is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.\nLetter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming.\n\n\u201c1 October.\n\n\r\n\u201cMy Lord,\n\n\u201cWe are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with\r\nregard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your\r\nbehalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and\r\npurchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors\r\nof the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign\r\nnobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the\r\npurchase money in notes \u2018over the counter,\u2019 if your Lordship will pardon\r\nus using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever\r\nof him.\n\r\n\u201cWe are, my Lord,\r\n\u201cYour Lordship\u2019s humble servants,\r\n\u201cMitchell, Sons & Candy.\u201d\n\nDr. Seward\u2019s Diary.\n2 October.\u2014I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to\r\nmake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield\u2019s room,\r\nand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he\r\nwas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire\r\nin the study\u2014Mrs. Harker having gone to bed\u2014we discussed the attempts\r\nand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,\r\nand we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient\u2019s room and looked in\r\nthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart\r\nrose and fell with regular respiration.\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight\r\nhe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him\r\nif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was\r\nsomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if\r\nhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \u201cdozed\u201d for\r\na while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are\r\nwatched.\nTo-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are\r\nlooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have\r\nhorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we\r\nseek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported\r\nearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his\r\nweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the\r\nBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old\r\nphysicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,\r\nand the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be\r\nuseful to us later.\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in\r\nstrait-waistcoats.\n\u00a0\nLater.\u2014We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our\r\nwork of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if\r\nRenfield\u2019s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so\r\nfollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the\r\nmonster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get\r\nsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument\r\nwith him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a\r\nvaluable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?\u2014\u2014 That\r\nwild yell seemed to come from his room....\n\u00a0\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had\r\nsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went\r\nto him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.\r\nI must go at once....\n3 October.\u2014Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well\r\nas I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I\r\ncan recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\nWhen I came to Renfield\u2019s room I found him lying on the floor on his\r\nleft side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it\r\nbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;\r\nthere seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body\r\nwhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see\r\nthat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the\r\nfloor\u2014indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\r\noriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\r\nwe turned him over:\u2014\n\u201cI think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\r\nthe whole side of his face are paralysed.\u201d How such a thing could have\r\nhappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite\r\nbewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:\u2014\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by\r\nbeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the\r\nEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he\r\nmight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward\r\nkink. But for the life of me I can\u2019t imagine how the two things\r\noccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn\u2019t beat his head; and if his\r\nface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of\r\nit.\u201d I said to him:\u2014\n\u201cGo to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want\r\nhim without an instant\u2019s delay.\u201d The man ran off, and within a few\r\nminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\r\nhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\r\nthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\r\nsaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:\u2014\n\u201cAh, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much\r\nattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.\r\nIf you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\u201d\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\r\nhe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with\r\nextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had\r\nevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\r\nlooked at the patient, he whispered to me:\u2014\n\u201cSend the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\r\nconscious, after the operation.\u201d So I said:\u2014\n\u201cI think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\r\npresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\r\nLet me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\u201d\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\r\nThe wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\r\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\r\nProfessor thought a moment and said:\u2014\n\u201cWe must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\r\nas can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\r\nhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\r\nbrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\r\ntoo late.\u201d As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\r\nwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\r\nQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:\u2014\n\u201cI heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\r\nSo I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\r\nare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\r\nthese times. I\u2019ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\r\nas they have been. We\u2019ll have to look back\u2014and forward a little more\r\nthan we have done. May we come in?\u201d I nodded, and held the door open\r\ntill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\r\nattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\r\nfloor, he said softly:\u2014\n\u201cMy God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\u201d I told him\r\nbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\r\nthe operation\u2014for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\r\ndown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\r\nin patience.\n\u201cWe shall wait,\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cjust long enough to fix the best\r\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\r\nthe blood clot; for it is evident that the h\u00e6morrhage is increasing.\u201d\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\r\nhorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing\u2019s face I gathered\r\nthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\r\nthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\r\nbut the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\r\nwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man\u2019s breathing came in\r\nuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\r\nand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\r\nwould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\r\nbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\r\nhear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\r\ntemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\r\nagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\r\ntheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\r\ntorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\r\nsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\r\nit.\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\r\nsinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\r\nand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\r\nspoke:\u2014\n\u201cThere is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\r\nbeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\r\nWe shall operate just above the ear.\u201d\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\r\nbreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\r\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\r\nSuddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\r\nThis was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\r\nsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\r\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said:\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\r\nhave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\r\nmove. What\u2019s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\r\ndreadfully.\u201d He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\r\neyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\r\nHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:\u2014\n\u201cTell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\u201d As he heard the voice his face\r\nbrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:\u2014\n\u201cThat is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\r\nwater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\u201d\u2014he\r\nstopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey\u2014\u201cThe\r\nbrandy\u2014it is in my study\u2014quick!\u201d He flew and returned with a glass,\r\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\r\nlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\r\ninjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\r\nconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\r\nshall never forget, and said:\u2014\n\u201cI must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\u201d\r\nThen his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\r\nfigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:\u2014\n\u201cIf I were not sure already, I would know from them.\u201d For an instant his\r\neyes closed\u2014not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\r\nbringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\r\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:\u2014\n\u201cQuick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\r\nand then I must go back to death\u2014or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\r\nagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\r\ncrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\r\nme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn\u2019t speak then, for I\r\nfelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\r\nI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\r\nme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\r\nseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\r\ndogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\u201d As he spoke, Van\r\nHelsing\u2019s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\r\ngripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\r\nand said: \u201cGo on,\u201d in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:\u2014\n\u201cHe came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\r\nbut he was solid then\u2014not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\r\nman\u2019s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\r\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\r\nof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn\u2019t ask him to come in\r\nat first, though I knew he wanted to\u2014just as he had wanted all along.\r\nThen he began promising me things\u2014not in words but by doing them.\u201d He\r\nwas interrupted by a word from the Professor:\u2014\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cBy making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\r\nsun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\r\nwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\r\nbacks.\u201d Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:\u2014\n\u201cThe Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges\u2014what you call the\r\n\u2018Death\u2019s-head Moth\u2019?\u201d The patient went on without stopping.\n\u201cThen he began to whisper: \u2018Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\r\nmillions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\r\ntoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\r\nbuzzing flies!\u2019 I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\r\nThen the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\r\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\r\nhands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\r\nspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\r\nthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\r\nwere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red\u2014like His, only\r\nsmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\r\nseemed to be saying: \u2018All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\r\nand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\r\nme!\u2019 And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\r\nover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\r\nthe sash and saying to Him: \u2018Come in, Lord and Master!\u2019 The rats were\r\nall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\r\nopen an inch wide\u2014just as the Moon herself has often come in through\r\nthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\r\nsplendour.\u201d\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\r\nhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\r\nthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\r\nback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \u201cLet him go on. Do\r\nnot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\r\nif once he lost the thread of his thought.\u201d He proceeded:\u2014\n\u201cAll day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\r\neven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\r\nWhen he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\r\nknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\r\nout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\r\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn\u2019t even smell the same\r\nas he went by me. I couldn\u2019t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\r\nHarker had come into the room.\u201d\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\r\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\r\nThey were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\r\nhowever, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\r\nnoticing:\u2014\n\u201cWhen Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\u2019t the same;\r\nit was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\u201d Here we all moved,\r\nbut no one said a word; he went on:\u2014\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn\u2019t look the\r\nsame. I don\u2019t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\r\nin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn\u2019t think of it\r\nat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\r\nto know that He had been taking the life out of her.\u201d I could feel that\r\nthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \u201cSo when\r\nHe came to-night I was ready for Him", "summary": "\nThe excerpt continues the Dracula narrative, opening with Van Helsing's failed attempt to interview the mental patient Renfield, who rudely dismisses him as an \"old fool.\" Van Helsing and Seward agree that Mina Harker should be excluded from their dangerous hunt for the vampire, though this decision troubles Mina, who feels left out of their confidence despite understanding the rationale.\nMina begins experiencing disturbing dreams involving mist entering her room and forming a pillar with glowing red eyes, reminiscent of Lucy's description before her death. She decides not to alarm the men but requests sleeping medication. Her health appears to be declining, though she tries to maintain a brave face. Renfield, meanwhile, shows unusual gentleness toward Mina during a brief visit.\nJonathan Harker continues investigating Dracula's movements, tracking down the men who transported the vampire's earth boxes. He learns that six boxes were delivered to an address in Mile End New Town and six more to Bermondsey. Through persistent investigation and strategic bribes, Harker discovers that nine additional boxes were moved to a house in Piccadilly. The delivery man describes helping \"an old gentleman with a white mustache\" who possessed extraordinary strength move the boxes. Harker locates this Piccadilly house and, posing as Lord Godalming's representative, approaches the real estate agency to learn more about the property.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Seward has further interactions with Renfield, whose behavior fluctuates between lucidity and madness. Their conversations center around souls and life, with Renfield becoming agitated when pressed about his desire for \"life\" without souls. Seward gradually develops a theory that Renfield has been in contact with Dracula and expects to gain some higher form of existence from him.\nThe group confirms that Dracula has dispersed his earth boxes to multiple locations throughout London, showing his methodical approach to establishing safe havens. They debate how to break into the Piccadilly house without being caught, awaiting information from the real estate agency that might provide legal access.\nThe narrative culminates dramatically when Renfield is found severely injured in his cell with a broken back and facial wounds. As Van Helsing performs an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain, Renfield regains consciousness briefly and reveals that Dracula had been visiting him. He describes how the Count appeared at his window and commanded rats to come to the asylum. Most disturbingly, Renfield reveals that Dracula has been \"taking the life out of\" Mina Harker, suggesting she has become the vampire's new victim. This shocking revelation brings the group to the horrifying realization that while they've been focused on hunting Dracula, he has been targeting Mina right under their noses.\n", "map": [["Renfield's connection to Dracula", "Gateway for vampire's influence"], ["Mina's disturbing dreams", "Early signs of vampire attack"], ["Exclusion from hunt", "Increases Mina's vulnerability"], ["Dracula's distributed earth boxes", "Strategic defensive network"], ["Harker's methodical investigation", "Tracking vampire's movement patterns"], ["Renfield's life without souls fixation", "Reflecting Dracula's corruption"], ["Mina's deteriorating health", "Evidence of vampire feeding"], ["Renfield's deathbed confession", "Reveals Dracula's secret activities"], ["Dracula's nocturnal visits", "Exploitation of group's distraction"], ["Vampire hunter's blind spot", "Neglect of immediate danger"]]}
