In a country where the ordinary rate of clear profit\r\nis eight or ten per cent. it may be reasonable that one half of it should go to\r\ninterest, wherever business is carried on with borrowed money. The stock is at\r\nthe risk of the borrower, who, as it were, insures it to the lender; and four\r\nor five per cent. may, in the greater part of trades, be both a sufficient\r\nprofit upon the risk of this insurance, and a sufficient recompence for the\r\ntrouble of employing the stock. But the proportion between interest and clear\r\nprofit might not be the same in countries where the ordinary rate of profit was\r\neither a good deal lower, or a good deal higher. If it were a good deal lower,\r\none half of it, perhaps, could not be afforded for interest; and more might be\r\nafforded if it were a good deal higher.\r\n\n\r\nIn countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit may, in\r\nthe price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of labour, and enable\r\nthose countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving neighbours, among whom\r\nthe wages of labour may be lower.\r\n\n\r\nIn reality, high profits tend much more to raise the price of work than high\r\nwages. If, in the linen manufacture, for example, the wages of the different\r\nworking people, the flax-dressers, the spinners, the weavers, etc. should all\r\nof them be advanced twopence a-day, it would be necessary to heighten the price\r\nof a piece of linen only by a number of twopences equal to the number of people\r\nthat had been employed about it, multiplied by the number of days during which\r\nthey had been so employed. That part of the price of the commodity which\r\nresolved itself into the wages, would, through all the different stages of the\r\nmanufacture, rise only in arithmetical proportion to this rise of wages. But if\r\nthe profits of all the different employers of those working people should be\r\nraised five per cent. that part of the price of the commodity which resolved\r\nitself into profit would, through all the different stages of the manufacture,\r\nrise in geometrical proportion to this rise of profit. The employer of the flax\r\ndressers would, in selling his flax, require an additional five per cent. upon\r\nthe whole value of the materials and wages which he advanced to his workmen.\r\nThe employer of the spinners would require an additional five per cent. both\r\nupon the advanced price of the flax, and upon the wages of the spinners. And\r\nthe employer of the weavers would require alike five per cent. both upon the\r\nadvanced price of the linen-yarn, and upon the wages of the weavers. In raising\r\nthe price of commodities, the rise of wages operates in the same manner as\r\nsimple interest does in the accumulation of debt. The rise of profit operates\r\nlike compound interest. Our merchants and master manufacturers complain much of\r\nthe bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the\r\nsale of their goods, both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the\r\nbad effects of high profits; they are silent with regard to the pernicious\r\neffects of their own gains; they complain only of those of other people.\r\n\n\r\nThe whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of\r\nlabour and stock, must, in the same neighbourhood, be either perfectly equal,\r\nor continually tending to equality. If, in the same neighbourhood, there was\r\nany employment evidently either more or less advantageous than the rest, so\r\nmany people would crowd into it in the one case, and so many would desert it in\r\nthe other, that its advantages would soon return to the level of other\r\nemployments. This, at least, would be the case in a society where things were\r\nleft to follow their natural course, where there was perfect liberty, and where\r\nevery man was perfectly free both to choose what occupation he thought proper,\r\nand to change it as often as he thought proper. Every man\u2019s interest\r\nwould prompt him to seek the advantageous, and to shun the disadvantageous\r\nemployment.\r\n\n\r\nPecuniary wages and profit, indeed, are everywhere in Europe extremely\r\ndifferent, according to the different employments of labour and stock. But this\r\ndifference arises, partly from certain circumstances in the employments\r\nthemselves, which, either really, or at least in the imagination of men, make\r\nup for a small pecuniary gain in some, and counterbalance a great one in\r\nothers, and partly from the policy of Europe, which nowhere leaves things at\r\nperfect liberty.\r\n\n\r\nThe particular consideration of those circumstances, and of that policy, will\r\ndivide this Chapter into two parts.\r\n\n\r\nThe five following are the principal circumstances which, so far as I have been\r\nable to observe, make up for a small pecuniary gain in some employments, and\r\ncounterbalance a great one in others. First, the agreeableness or\r\ndisagreeableness of the employments themselves; secondly, the easiness and\r\ncheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning them; thirdly, the\r\nconstancy or inconstancy of employment in them; fourthly, the small or great\r\ntrust which must be reposed in those who exercise them; and, fifthly, the\r\nprobability or improbability of success in them.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, the wages of labour vary with the ease or hardship, the cleanliness or\r\ndirtiness, the honourableness or dishonourableness, of the employment. Thus in\r\nmost places, take the year round, a journeyman tailor earns less than a\r\njourneyman weaver. His work is much easier. A journeyman weaver earns less than\r\na journeyman smith. His work is not always easier, but it is much cleanlier. A\r\njourneyman blacksmith, though an artificer, seldom earns so much in twelve\r\nhours, as a collier, who is only a labourer, does in eight. His work is not\r\nquite so dirty, is less dangerous, and is carried on in day-light, and above\r\nground. Honour makes a great part of the reward of all honourable professions.\r\nIn point of pecuniary gain, all things considered, they are generally\r\nunder-recompensed, as I shall endeavour to shew by and by. Disgrace has the\r\ncontrary effect. The trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business; but\r\nit is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades.\r\nThe most detestable of all employments, that of public executioner, is, in\r\nproportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any common trade\r\nwhatever.\r\n\n\r\nHunting and fishing, the most important employments of mankind in the rude\r\nstate of society, become, in its advanced state, their most agreeable\r\namusements, and they pursue for pleasure what they once followed from\r\nnecessity. In the advanced state of society, therefore, they are all very poor\r\npeople who follow as a trade, what other people pursue as a pastime. Fishermen\r\nhave been so since the time of Theocritus. {See Idyllium xxi.}. A poacher is\r\neverywhere a very poor man in Great Britain. In countries where the rigour of\r\nthe law suffers no poachers, the licensed hunter is not in a much better\r\ncondition. The natural taste for those employments makes more people follow\r\nthem, than can live comfortably by them; and the produce of their labour, in\r\nproportion to its quantity, comes always too cheap to market, to afford any\r\nthing but the most scanty subsistence to the labourers.\r\n\n\r\nDisagreeableness and disgrace affect the profits of stock in the same manner as\r\nthe wages of labour. The keeper of an inn or tavern, who is never master of his\r\nown house, and who is exposed to the brutality of every drunkard, exercises\r\nneither a very agreeable nor a very creditable business. But there is scarce\r\nany common trade in which a small stock yields so great a profit.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, the wages of labour vary with the easiness and cheapness, or the\r\ndifficulty and expense, of learning the business.\r\n\n\r\nWhen any expensive machine is erected, the extraordinary work to be performed\r\nby it before it is worn out, it must be expected, will replace the capital laid\r\nout upon it, with at least the ordinary profits. A man educated at the expense\r\nof much labour and time to any of those employments which require extraordinary\r\ndexterity and skill, may be compared to one of those expensive machines. The\r\nwork which he learns to perform, it must be expected, over and above the usual\r\nwages of common labour, will replace to him the whole expense of his education,\r\nwith at least the ordinary profits of an equally valuable capital. It must do\r\nthis too in a reasonable time, regard being had to the very uncertain duration\r\nof human life, in the same manner as to the more certain duration of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\n\r\nThe difference between the wages of skilled labour and those of common labour,\r\nis founded upon this principle.\r\n\n\r\nThe policy of Europe considers the labour of all mechanics, artificers, and\r\nmanufacturers, as skilled labour; and that of all country labourers as common\r\nlabour. It seems to suppose that of the former to be of a more nice and\r\ndelicate nature than that of the latter. It is so perhaps in some cases; but in\r\nthe greater part it is quite otherwise, as I shall endeavour to shew by and by.\r\nThe laws and customs of Europe, therefore, in order to qualify any person for\r\nexercising the one species of labour, impose the necessity of an\r\napprenticeship, though with different degrees of rigour in different places.\r\nThey leave the other free and open to every body. During the continuance of the\r\napprenticeship, the whole labour of the apprentice belongs to his master. In\r\nthe meantime he must, in many cases, be maintained by his parents or relations,\r\nand, in almost all cases, must be clothed by them. Some money, too, is commonly\r\ngiven to the master for teaching him his trade. They who cannot give money,\r\ngive time, or become bound for more than the usual number of years; a\r\nconsideration which, though it is not always advantageous to the master, on\r\naccount of the usual idleness of apprentices, is always disadvantageous to the\r\napprentice. In country labour, on the contrary, the labourer, while he is\r\nemployed about the easier, learns the more difficult parts of his business, and\r\nhis own labour maintains him through all the different stages of his\r\nemployment. It is reasonable, therefore, that in Europe the wages of mechanics,\r\nartificers, and manufacturers, should be somewhat higher than those of common\r\nlabourers. They are so accordingly, and their superior gains make them, in most\r\nplaces, be considered as a superior rank of people. This superiority, however,\r\nis generally very small: the daily or weekly earnings of journeymen in the more\r\ncommon sorts of manufactures, such as those of plain linen and woollen cloth,\r\ncomputed at an average, are, in most places, very little more than the\r\nday-wages of common labourers. Their employment, indeed, is more steady and\r\nuniform, and the superiority of their earnings, taking the whole year together,\r\nmay be somewhat greater. It seems evidently, however, to be no greater than\r\nwhat is sufficient to compensate the superior expense of their education.\r\nEducation in the ingenious arts, and in the liberal professions, is still more\r\ntedious and expensive. The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of painters and\r\nsculptors, of lawyers and physicians, ought to be much more liberal; and it is\r\nso accordingly.\r\n\n\r\nThe profits of stock seem to be very little affected by the easiness or\r\ndifficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed. All the different\r\nways in which stock is commonly employed in great towns seem, in reality, to be\r\nalmost equally easy and equally difficult to learn. One branch, either of\r\nforeign or domestic trade, cannot well be a much more intricate business than\r\nanother.\r\n\n\r\nThirdly, the wages of labour in different occupations vary with the constancy\r\nor inconstancy of employment.\r\n\n\r\nEmployment is much more constant in some trades than in others. In the greater\r\npart of manufactures, a journeyman maybe pretty sure of employment almost every\r\nday in the year that he is able to work. A mason or bricklayer, on the\r\ncontrary, can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather, and his\r\nemployment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his\r\ncustomers. He is liable, in consequence, to be frequently without any. What he\r\nearns, therefore, while he is employed, must not only maintain him while he is\r\nidle, but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments\r\nwhich the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion. Where\r\nthe computed earnings of the greater part of manufacturers, accordingly, are\r\nnearly upon a level with the day-wages of common labourers, those of masons and\r\nbricklayers are generally from one-half more to double those wages. Where\r\ncommon labourers earn four or five shillings a-week, masons and bricklayers\r\nfrequently earn seven and eight; where the former earn six, the latter often\r\nearn nine and ten; and where the former earn nine and ten, as in London, the\r\nlatter commonly earn fifteen and eighteen. No species of skilled labour,\r\nhowever, seems more easy to learn than that of masons and bricklayers. Chairmen\r\nin London, during the summer season, are said sometimes to be employed as\r\nbricklayers. The high wages of those workmen, therefore, are not so much the\r\nrecompence of their skill, as the compensation for the inconstancy of their\r\nemployment.\r\n\n\r\nA house-carpenter seems to exercise rather a nicer and a more ingenious trade\r\nthan a mason. In most places, however, for it is not universally so, his\r\nday-wages are somewhat lower. His employment, though it depends much, does not\r\ndepend so entirely upon the occasional calls of his customers; and it is not\r\nliable to be interrupted by the weather.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the trades which generally afford constant employment, happen in a\r\nparticular place not to do so, the wages of the workmen always rise a good deal\r\nabove their ordinary proportion to those of common labour. In London, almost\r\nall journeymen artificers are liable to be called upon and dismissed by their\r\nmasters from day to day, and from week to week, in the same manner as\r\nday-labourers in other places. The lowest order of artificers, journeymen\r\ntailors, accordingly, earn their half-a-crown a-day, though eighteen pence may\r\nbe reckoned the wages of common labour. In small towns and country villages,\r\nthe wages of journeymen tailors frequently scarce equal those of common labour;\r\nbut in London they are often many weeks without employment, particularly during\r\nthe summer.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship,\r\ndisagreeableness, and dirtiness of the work, it sometimes raises the wages of\r\nthe most common labour above those of the most skilful artificers. A collier\r\nworking by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly about double,\r\nand, in many parts of Scotland, about three times, the wages of common labour.\r\nHis high wages arise altogether from the hardship, disagreeableness, and\r\ndirtiness of his work. His employment may, upon most occasions, be as constant\r\nas he pleases. The coal-heavers in London exercise a trade which, in hardship,\r\ndirtiness, and disagreeableness, almost equals that of colliers; and, from the\r\nunavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal-ships, the employment of the\r\ngreater part of them is necessarily very inconstant. If colliers, therefore,\r\ncommonly earn double and triple the wages of common labour, it ought not to\r\nseem unreasonable that coal-heavers should sometimes earn four and five times\r\nthose wages. In the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago, it was\r\nfound that, at the rate at which they were then paid, they could earn from six\r\nto ten shillings a-day. Six shillings are about four times the wages of common\r\nlabour in London; and, in every particular trade, the lowest common earnings\r\nmay always be considered as those of the far greater number. How extravagant\r\nsoever those earnings may appear, if they were more than sufficient to\r\ncompensate all the disagreeable circumstances of the business, there would soon\r\nbe so great a number of competitors, as, in a trade which has no exclusive\r\nprivilege, would quickly reduce them to a lower rate.\r\n\n\r\nThe constancy or inconstancy of employment cannot affect the ordinary profits\r\nof stock in any particular trade. Whether the stock is or is not constantly\r\nemployed, depends, not upon the trade, but the trader.\r\n\n\r\nFourthly, the wages of labour vary according to the small or great trust which\r\nmust be reposed in the workmen.\r\n\n\r\nThe wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are everywhere superior to those of many\r\nother workmen, not only of equal, but of much superior ingenuity, on account of\r\nthe precious materials with which they are entrusted. We trust our health to\r\nthe physician, our fortune, and sometimes our life and reputation, to the\r\nlawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a\r\nvery mean or low condition. Their reward must be such, therefore, as may give\r\nthem that rank in the society which so important a trust requires. The long\r\ntime and the great expense which must be laid out in their education, when\r\ncombined with this circumstance, necessarily enhance still further the price of\r\ntheir labour.\r\n\n\r\nWhen a person employs only his own stock in trade, there is no trust; and the\r\ncredit which he may get from other people, depends, not upon the nature of the\r\ntrade, but upon their opinion of his fortune, probity and prudence. The\r\ndifferent rates of profit, therefore, in the different branches of trade,\r\ncannot arise from the different degrees of trust reposed in the traders.\r\n\n\r\nFifthly, the wages of labour in different employments vary according to the\r\nprobability or improbability of success in them.\r\n\n\r\nThe probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the\r\nemployments to which he is educated, is very different in different\r\noccupations. In the greatest part of mechanic trades success is almost certain;\r\nbut very uncertain in the liberal professions. Put your son apprentice to a\r\nshoemaker, there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes; but\r\nsend him to study the law, it as at least twenty to one if he ever makes such\r\nproficiency as will enable him to live by the business. In a perfectly fair\r\nlottery, those who draw the prizes ought to gain all that is lost by those who\r\ndraw the blanks. In a profession, where twenty fail for one that succeeds, that\r\none ought to gain all that should have been gained by the unsuccessful twenty.\r\nThe counsellor at law, who, perhaps, at near forty years of age, begins to make\r\nsomething by his profession, ought to receive the retribution, not only of his\r\nown so tedious and expensive education, but of that of more than twenty others,\r\nwho are never likely to make any thing by it. How extravagant soever the fees\r\nof counsellors at law may sometimes appear, their real retribution is never\r\nequal to this. Compute, in any particular place, what is likely to be annually\r\ngained, and what is likely to be annually spent, by all the different workmen\r\nin any common trade, such as that of shoemakers or weavers, and you will find\r\nthat the former sum will generally exceed the latter. But make the same\r\ncomputation with regard to all the counsellors and students of law, in all the\r\ndifferent Inns of Court, and you will find that their annual gains bear but a\r\nvery small proportion to their annual expense, even though you rate the former\r\nas high, and the latter as low, as can well be done. The lottery of the law,\r\ntherefore, is very far from being a perfectly fair lottery; and that as well as\r\nmany other liberal and honourable professions, is, in point of pecuniary gain,\r\nevidently under-recompensed.\r\n\n\r\nThose professions keep their level, however, with other occupations; and,\r\nnotwithstanding these discouragements, all the most generous and liberal\r\nspirits are eager to crowd into them. Two different causes contribute to\r\nrecommend them. First, the desire of the reputation which attends upon superior\r\nexcellence in any of them; and, secondly, the natural confidence which every\r\nman has, more or less, not only in his own abilities, but in his own good\r\nfortune.\r\n\n\r\nTo excel in any profession, in which but few arrive at mediocrity, is the most\r\ndecisive mark of what is called genius, or superior talents. The public\r\nadmiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities makes always a part\r\nof their reward; a greater or smaller, in proportion as it is higher or lower\r\nin degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of\r\nphysic; a still greater, perhaps, in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it\r\nmakes almost the whole.\r\n\n\r\nThere are some very agreeable and beautiful talents, of which the possession\r\ncommands a certain sort of admiration, but of which the exercise, for the sake\r\nof gain, is considered, whether from reason or prejudice, as a sort of public\r\nprostitution. The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of those who exercise them\r\nin this manner, must be sufficient, not only to pay for the time, labour, and\r\nexpense of acquiring the talents, but for the discredit which attends the\r\nemployment of them as the means of subsistence. The exorbitant rewards of\r\nplayers, opera-singers, opera-dancers, etc. are founded upon those two\r\nprinciples; the rarity and beauty of the talents, and the discredit of\r\nemploying them in this manner. It seems absurd at first sight, that we should\r\ndespise their persons, and yet reward their talents with the most profuse\r\nliberality. While we do the one, however, we must of necessity do the other,\r\nShould the public opinion or prejudice ever alter with regard to such\r\noccupations, their pecuniary recompence would quickly diminish. More people\r\nwould apply to them, and the competition would quickly reduce the price of\r\ntheir labour. Such talents, though far from being common, are by no means so\r\nrare as imagined. Many people possess them in great perfection, who disdain to\r\nmake this use of them; and many more are capable of acquiring them, if any\r\nthing could be made honourably by them.\r\n\n\r\nThe over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own\r\nabilities, is an ancient evil remarked by the philosophers and moralists of all\r\nages. Their absurd presumption in their own good fortune has been less taken\r\nnotice of. It is, however, if possible, still more universal. There is no man\r\nliving, who, when in tolerable health and spirits, has not some share of it.\r\nThe chance of gain is by every man more or less over-valued, and the chance of\r\nloss is by most men under-valued, and by scarce any man, who is in tolerable\r\nhealth and spirits, valued more than it is worth.\r\n\n\r\nThat the chance of gain is naturally overvalued, we may learn from the\r\nuniversal success of lotteries. The world neither ever saw, nor ever will see,\r\na perfectly fair lottery, or one in which the whole gain compensated the whole\r\nloss; because the undertaker could make nothing by it. In the state lotteries,\r\nthe tickets are really not worth the price which is paid by the original\r\nsubscribers, and yet commonly sell in the market for twenty, thirty, and\r\nsometimes forty per cent. advance. The vain hopes of gaining some of the great\r\nprizes is the sole cause of this demand. The soberest people scarce look upon\r\nit as a folly to pay a small sum for the chance of gaining ten or twenty\r\nthousand pounds, though they know that even that small sum is perhaps twenty or\r\nthirty per cent. more than the chance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize\r\nexceeded twenty pounds, though in other respects it approached much nearer to a\r\nperfectly fair one than the common state lotteries, there would not be the same\r\ndemand for tickets. In order to have a better chance for some of the great\r\nprizes, some people purchase several tickets; and others, small shares in a\r\nstill greater number. There is not, however, a more certain proposition in\r\nmathematics, than that the more tickets you adventure upon, the more likely you\r\nare to be a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose\r\nfor certain; and the greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you\r\napproach to this certainty.\r\n\n\r\nThat the chance of loss is frequently undervalued, and scarce ever valued more\r\nthan it is worth, we may learn from the very moderate profit of insurers. In\r\norder to make insurance, either from fire or sea-risk, a trade at all, the\r\ncommon premium must be sufficient to compensate the common losses, to pay the\r\nexpense of management, and to afford such a profit as might have been drawn\r\nfrom an equal capital employed in any common trade. The person who pays no more\r\nthan this, evidently pays no more than the real value of the risk, or the\r\nlowest price at which he can reasonably expect to insure it. But though many\r\npeople have made a little money by insurance, very few have made a great\r\nfortune; and, from this consideration alone, it seems evident enough that the\r\nordinary balance of profit and loss is not more advantageous in this than in\r\nother common trades, by which so many people make fortunes. Moderate, however,\r\nas the premium of insurance commonly is, many people despise the risk too much\r\nto care to pay it. Taking the whole kingdom at an average, nineteen houses in\r\ntwenty, or rather, perhaps, ninety-nine in a hundred, are not insured from\r\nfire. Sea-risk is more alarming to the greater part of people; and the\r\nproportion of ships insured to those not insured is much greater. Many sail,\r\nhowever, at all seasons, and even in time of war, without any insurance. This\r\nmay sometimes, perhaps, be done without any imprudence. When a great company,\r\nor even a great merchant, has twenty or thirty ships at sea, they may, as it\r\nwere, insure one another. The premium saved up on them all may more than\r\ncompensate such losses as they are likely to meet with in the common course of\r\nchances. The neglect of insurance upon shipping, however, in the same manner as\r\nupon houses, is, in most cases, the effect of no such nice calculation, but of\r\nmere thoughtless rashness, and presumptuous contempt of the risk.\r\n\n\r\nThe contempt of risk, and the presumptuous hope of success, are in no period of\r\nlife more active than at the age at which young people choose their\r\nprofessions. How little the fear of misfortune is then capable of balancing the\r\nhope of good luck, appears still more evidently in the readiness of the common\r\npeople to enlist as soldiers, or to go to sea, than in the eagerness of those\r\nof better fashion to enter into what are called the liberal professions.\r\n\n\r\nWhat a common soldier may lose is obvious enough. Without regarding the danger,\r\nhowever, young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the beginning of a new\r\nwar; and though they have scarce any chance of preferment, they figure to\r\nthemselves, in their youthful fancies, a thousand occasions of acquiring honour\r\nand distinction which never occur. These romantic hopes make the whole price of\r\ntheir blood. Their pay is less than that of common labourers, and, in actual\r\nservice, their fatigues are much greater.\r\n\n\r\nThe lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that of the\r\narmy. The son of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go to sea\r\nwith his father\u2019s consent; but if he enlists as a soldier, it is always\r\nwithout it. Other people see some chance of his making something by the one\r\ntrade; nobody but himself sees any of his making any thing by the other. The\r\ngreat admiral is less the object of public admiration than the great general;\r\nand the highest success in the sea service promises a less brilliant fortune\r\nand reputation than equal success in the land. The same difference runs through\r\nall the inferior degrees of preferment in both. By the rules of precedency, a\r\ncaptain in the navy ranks with a colonel in the army; but he does not rank with\r\nhim in the common estimation. As the great prizes in the lottery are less, the\r\nsmaller ones must be more numerous. Common sailors, therefore, more frequently\r\nget some fortune and preferment than common soldiers; and the hope of those\r\nprizes is what principally recommends the trade. Though their skill and\r\ndexterity are much superior to that of almost any artificers; and though their\r\nwhole life is one continual scene of hardship and danger; yet for all this\r\ndexterity and skill, for all those hardships and dangers, while they remain in\r\nthe condition of common sailors, they receive scarce any other recompence but\r\nthe pleasure of exercising the one and of surmounting the other. Their wages\r\nare not greater than those of common labourers at the port which regulates the\r\nrate of seamen\u2019s wages. As they are continually going from port to port,\r\nthe monthly pay of those who sail from all the different ports of Great\r\nBritain, is more nearly upon a level than that of any other workmen in those\r\ndifferent places; and the rate of the port to and from which the greatest\r\nnumber sail, that is, the port of London, regulates that of all the rest. At\r\nLondon, the wages of the greater part of the different classes of workmen are\r\nabout double those of the same classes at Edinburgh. But the sailors who sail\r\nfrom the port of London, seldom earn above three or four shillings a month more\r\nthan those who sail from the port of Leith, and the difference is frequently\r\nnot so great. In time of peace, and in the merchant-service, the London price\r\nis from a guinea to about seven-and-twenty shillings the calendar month. A\r\ncommon labourer in London, at the rate of nine or ten shillings a week, may\r\nearn in the calendar month from forty to five-and-forty shillings. The sailor,\r\nindeed, over and above his pay, is supplied with provisions. Their value,\r\nhowever, may not perhaps always exceed the difference between his pay and that\r\nof the common labourer; and though it sometimes should, the excess will not be\r\nclear gain to the sailor, because he cannot share it with his wife and family,\r\nwhom he must maintain out of his wages at home.\r\n\n\r\nThe dangers and hair-breadth escapes of a life of adventures, instead of\r\ndisheartening young people, seem frequently to recommend a trade to them. A\r\ntender mother, among the inferior ranks of people, is often afraid to send her\r\nson to school at a sea-port town, lest the sight of the ships, and the\r\nconversation and adventures of the sailors, should entice him to go to sea. The\r\ndistant prospect of hazards, from which we can hope to extricate ourselves by\r\ncourage and address, is not disagreeable to us, and does not raise the wages of\r\nlabour in any employment. It is otherwise with those in which courage and\r\naddress can be of no avail. In trades which are known to be very unwholesome,\r\nthe wages of labour are always remarkably high. Unwholesomeness is a species of\r\ndisagreeableness, and its effects upon the wages of labour are to be ranked\r\nunder that general head.\r\n\n\r\nIn all the different employments of stock, the ordinary rate of profit varies\r\nmore or less with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns. These are, in\r\ngeneral, less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign trade, and in some\r\nbranches of foreign trade than in others; in the trade to North America, for\r\nexample, than in that to Jamaica. The ordinary rate of profit always rises more\r\nor less with the risk. It does not, however, seem to rise in proportion to it,\r\nor so as to compensate it completely. Bankruptcies are most frequent in the\r\nmost hazardous trades. The most hazardous of all trades, that of a smuggler,\r\nthough, when the adventure succeeds, it is likewise the most profitable, is the\r\ninfallible road to bankruptcy. The presumptuous hope of success seems to act\r\nhere as upon all other occasions, and to entice so many adventurers into those\r\nhazardous trades, that their competition reduces the profit below what is\r\nsufficient to compensate the risk. To compensate it completely, the common\r\nreturns ought, over and above the ordinary profits of stock, not only to make\r\nup for all occasional losses, but to afford a surplus profit to the\r\nadventurers, of the same nature with the profit of insurers. But if the common\r\nreturns were sufficient for all this, bankruptcies would not be more frequent\r\nin these than in other trades.\r\n\n\r\nOf the five circumstances, therefore, which vary the wages of labour, two only\r\naffect the profits of stock; the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the\r\nbusiness, and the risk or security with which it is attended. In point of\r\nagreeableness or disagreeableness, there is little or no difference in the far\r\ngreater part of the different employments of stock, but a great deal in those\r\nof labour; and the ordinary profit of stock, though it rises with the risk,\r\ndoes not always seem to rise in proportion to it. It should follow from all\r\nthis, that, in the same society or neighbourhood, the average and ordinary\r\nrates of profit in the different employments of stock should be more nearly\r\nupon a level than the pecuniary wages of the different sorts of labour.\r\n\n\r\nThey are so accordingly. The difference between the earnings of a common\r\nlabourer and those of a well employed lawyer or physician, is evidently much\r\ngreater than that between the ordinary profits in any two different branches of\r\ntrade. The apparent difference, besides, in the profits of different trades, is\r\ngenerally a deception arising from our not always distinguishing what ought to\r\nbe considered as wages, from what ought to be considered as profit.\r\n\n\r\nApothecaries\u2019 profit is become a bye-word, denoting something uncommonly\r\nextravagant. This great apparent profit, however, is frequently no more than\r\nthe reasonable wages of labour. The skill of an apothecary is a much nicer and\r\nmore delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever; and the trust which\r\nis reposed in him is of much greater importance. He is the physician of the\r\npoor in all cases, and of the rich when the distress or danger is not very\r\ngreat. His reward, therefore, ought to be suitable to his skill and his trust;\r\nand it arises generally from the price at which he sells his drugs. But the\r\nwhole drugs which the best employed apothecary in a large market-town, will\r\nsell in a year, may not perhaps cost him above thirty or forty pounds. Though\r\nhe should sell them, therefore, for three or four hundred, or at a thousand per\r\ncent. profit, this may frequently be no more than the reasonable wages of his\r\nlabour, charged, in the only way in which he can charge them, upon the price of\r\nhis drugs. The greater part of the apparent profit is real wages disguised in\r\nthe garb of profit.\r\n\n\r\nIn a small sea-port town, a little grocer will make forty or fifty per cent.\r\nupon a stock of a single hundred pounds, while a considerable wholesale\r\nmerchant in the same place will scarce make eight or ten per cent. upon a stock\r\nof ten thousand. The trade of the grocer may be necessary for the conveniency\r\nof the inhabitants, and the narrowness of the market may not admit the\r\nemployment of a larger capital in the business. The man, however, must not only\r\nlive by his trade, but live by it suitably to the qualifications which it\r\nrequires. Besides possessing a little capital, he must be able to read, write,\r\nand account and must be a tolerable judge, too, of perhaps fifty or sixty\r\ndifferent sorts of goods, their prices, qualities, and the markets where they\r\nare to be had cheapest. He must have all the knowledge, in short, that is\r\nnecessary for a great merchant, which nothing hinders him from becoming but the\r\nwant of a sufficient capital. Thirty or forty pounds a year cannot be\r\nconsidered as too great a recompence for the labour of a person so\r\naccomplished. Deduct this from the seemingly great profits of his capital, and\r\nlittle more will remain, perhaps, than the ordinary profits of stock. The\r\ngreater part of the apparent profit is, in this case too, real wages.\r\n\n\r\nThe difference between the apparent profit of the retail and that of the\r\nwholesale trade, is much less in the capital than in small towns and country\r\nvillages. Where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the grocery trade, the\r\nwages of the grocer\u2019s labour must be a very trifling addition to the real\r\nprofits of so great a stock. The apparent profits of the wealthy retailer,\r\ntherefore, are there more nearly upon a level with those of the wholesale\r\nmerchant. It is upon this account that goods sold by retail are generally as\r\ncheap, and frequently much cheaper, in the capital than in small towns and\r\ncountry villages. Grocery goods, for example, are generally much cheaper; bread\r\nand butchers\u2019 meat frequently as cheap. It costs no more to bring grocery\r\ngoods to the great town than to the country village; but it costs a great deal\r\nmore to bring corn and cattle, as the greater part of them must be brought from\r\na much greater distance. The prime cost of grocery goods, therefore, being the\r\nsame in both places, they are cheapest where the least profit is charged upon\r\nthem. The prime cost of bread and butchers\u2019 meat is greater in the great\r\ntown than in the country village; and though the profit is less, therefore they\r\nare not always cheaper there, but often equally cheap. In such articles as\r\nbread and butchers\u2019 meat, the same cause which diminishes apparent\r\nprofit, increases prime cost. The extent of the market, by giving employment to\r\ngreater stocks, diminishes apparent profit; but by requiring supplies from a\r\ngreater distance, it increases prime cost. This diminution of the one and\r\nincrease of the other, seem, in most cases, nearly to counterbalance one\r\nanother; which is probably the reason that, though the prices of corn and\r\ncattle are commonly very different in different parts of the kingdom, those of\r\nbread and butchers\u2019 meat are generally very nearly the same through the\r\ngreater part of it.\r\n\n\r\nThough the profits of stock, both in the wholesale and retail trade, are\r\ngenerally less in the capital than in small towns and country villages, yet\r\ngreat fortunes are frequently acquired from small beginnings in the former, and\r\nscarce ever in the latter. In small towns and country villages, on account of\r\nthe narrowness of the market, trade cannot always be extended as stock extends.\r\nIn such places, therefore, though the rate of a particular person\u2019s\r\nprofits may be very high, the sum or amount of them can never be very great,\r\nnor consequently that of his annual accumulation. In great towns, on the\r\ncontrary, trade can be extended as stock increases, and the credit of a frugal\r\nand thriving man increases much faster than his stock. His trade is extended in\r\nproportion to the amount of both; and the sum or amount of his profits is in\r\nproportion to the extent of his trade, and his annual accumulation in\r\nproportion to the amount of his profits. It seldom happens, however, that great\r\nfortunes are made, even in great towns, by any one regular, established, and\r\nwell-known branch of business, but in consequence of a long life of industry,\r\nfrugality, and attention. Sudden fortunes, indeed, are sometimes made in such\r\nplaces, by what is called the trade of speculation. The speculative merchant\r\nexercises no one regular, established, or well-known branch of business. He is\r\na corn merchant this year, and a wine merchant the next, and a sugar, tobacco,\r\nor tea merchant the year after. He enters into every trade, when he foresees\r\nthat it is likely to be more than commonly profitable, and he quits it when he\r\nforesees that its profits are likely to return to the level of other trades.\r\nHis profits and losses, therefore, can bear no regular proportion to those of\r\nany one established and well-known branch of business. A bold adventurer may\r\nsometimes acquire a considerable fortune by two or three successful\r\nspeculations, but is just as likely to lose one by two or three unsuccessful\r\nones. This trade can be carried on nowhere but in great towns. It is only in\r\nplaces of the most extensive commerce and correspondence that the intelligence\r\nrequisite for it can be had.\r\n\n\r\nThe five circumstances above mentioned, though they occasion considerable\r\ninequalities in the wages of labour and profits of stock, occasion none in the\r\nwhole of the advantages and disadvantages, real or imaginary, of the different\r\nemployments of either. The nature of those circumstances is such, that they\r\nmake up for a small pecuniary gain in some, and counterbalance a great one in\r\nothers.\r\n\n\r\nIn order, however, that this equality may take place in the whole of their\r\nadvantages or disadvantages, three things are requisite, even where there is\r\nthe most perfect freedom. First the employments must be well known and long\r\nestablished in the neighbourhood; secondly, they must be in their ordinary, or\r\nwhat may be called their natural state; and, thirdly, they must be the sole or\r\nprincipal employments of those who occupy them.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, this equality can take place only in those employments which are well\r\nknown, and have been long established in the neighbourhood.\r\n\n\r\nWhere all other circumstances are equal, wages are generally higher in new than\r\nin old trades. When a projector attempts to establish a new manufacture, he\r\nmust at first entice his workmen from other employments, by higher wages than\r\nthey can either earn in their own trades, or than the nature of his work would\r\notherwise require; and a considerable time must pass away before he can venture\r\nto reduce them to the common level. Manufactures for which the demand arises\r\naltogether from fashion and fancy, are continually changing, and seldom last\r\nlong enough to be considered as old established manufactures. Those, on the\r\ncontrary, for which the demand arises chiefly from use or necessity, are less\r\nliable to change, and the same form or fabric may continue in demand for whole\r\ncenturies together. The wages of labour, therefore, are likely to be higher in\r\nmanufactures of the former, than in those of the latter kind. Birmingham deals\r\nchiefly in manufactures of the former kind; Sheffield in those of the latter;\r\nand the wages of labour in those two different places are said to be suitable\r\nto this difference in the nature of their manufactures.\r\n\n\r\nThe establishment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce, or of\r\nany new practice in agriculture, is always a speculation from which the\r\nprojector promises himself extraordinary profits. These profits sometimes are\r\nvery great, and sometimes, more frequently, perhaps, they are quite otherwise;\r\nbut, in general, they bear no regular proportion to those of other old trades\r\nin the neighbourhood. If the project succeeds, they are commonly at first very\r\nhigh. When the trade or practice becomes thoroughly established and well known,\r\nthe competition reduces them to the level of other trades.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the\r\ndifferent employments of labour and stock, can take place only in the ordinary,\r\nor what may be called the natural state of those employments.\r\n\n\r\nThe demand for almost every different species of labour is sometimes greater,\r\nand sometimes less than usual. In the one case, the advantages of the\r\nemployment rise above, in the other they fall below the common level. The\r\ndemand for country labour is greater at hay-time and harvest than during the\r\ngreater part of the year; and wages rise with the demand. In time of war, when\r\nforty or fifty thousand sailors are forced from the merchant service into that\r\nof the king, the demand for sailors to merchant ships necessarily rises with\r\ntheir scarcity; and their wages, upon such occasions, commonly rise from a\r\nguinea and seven-and-twenty shillings to forty shillings and three pounds\r\na-month. In a decaying manufacture, on the contrary, many workmen, rather than\r\nquit their own trade, are contented with smaller wages than would otherwise be\r\nsuitable to the nature of their employment.\r\n\n\r\nThe profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which it is\r\nemployed. As the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary or average\r\nrate, the profits of at least some part of the stock that is employed in\r\nbringing it to market, rise above their proper level, and as it falls they sink\r\nbelow it. All commodities are more or less liable to variations of price, but\r\nsome are much more so than others. In all commodities which are produced by\r\nhuman industry, the quantity of industry annually employed is necessarily\r\nregulated by the annual demand, in such a manner that the average annual\r\nproduce may, as nearly as possible, be equal to the average annual consumption.\r\nIn some employments, it has already been observed, the same quantity of\r\nindustry will always produce the same, or very nearly the same quantity of\r\ncommodities. In the linen or woollen manufactures, for example, the same number\r\nof hands will annually work up very nearly the same quantity of linen and\r\nwoollen cloth. The variations in the market price of such commodities,\r\ntherefore, can arise only from some accidental variation in the demand. A\r\npublic mourning raises the price of black cloth. But as the demand for most\r\nsorts of plain linen and woollen cloth is pretty uniform, so is likewise the\r\nprice. But there are other employments in which the same quantity of industry\r\nwill not always produce the same quantity of commodities. The same quantity of\r\nindustry, for example, will, in different years, produce very different\r\nquantities of corn, wine, hops, sugar tobacco, etc. The price of such\r\ncommodities, therefore, varies not only with the variations of demand, but with\r\nthe much greater and more frequent variations of quantity, and is consequently\r\nextremely fluctuating; but the profit of some of the dealers must necessarily\r\nfluctuate with the price of the commodities. The operations of the speculative\r\nmerchant are principally employed about such commodities. He endeavours to buy\r\nthem up when he foresees that their price is likely to rise, and to sell them\r\nwhen it is likely to fall.\r\n\n\r\nThirdly, this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the\r\ndifferent employments of labour and stock, can take place only in such as are\r\nthe sole or principal employments of those who occupy them.\r\n\n\r\nWhen a person derives his subsistence from one employment, which does not\r\noccupy the greater part of his time, in the intervals of his leisure he is\r\noften willing to work at another for less wages than would otherwise suit the\r\nnature of the employment", "summary": "\nThe text examines the factors influencing wages and profits across different occupations. It begins by discussing the relationship between interest rates and profit rates, noting that what merchants consider \"good, moderate, reasonable profit\" in Great Britain is double the interest rate. When businesses operate with borrowed money, approximately half the profit may reasonably go to interest since the borrower bears the risk.\nThe author identifies five principal circumstances that create wage differentials. First, wages vary with the agreeableness or disagreeableness of employment. Disagreeable jobs like butchering or public execution command higher wages, while initially necessary occupations that become recreational activities (like hunting and fishing) typically yield poor compensation. Second, wages reflect the difficulty and expense of training. Education is compared to an expensive machine, where the investment must be recovered through higher wages. This explains why skilled labor generally earns more than common labor.\nThird, employment constancy affects compensation. Masons and bricklayers earn more than carpenters because their work depends on weather and customer demand. Coal-heavers in London may earn four to five times common labor wages due to both dirty conditions and irregular employment. Fourth, wages increase with trust requirements. Goldsmiths, physicians, and lawyers command higher wages because they are entrusted with valuable materials, health, or fortunes. Fifth, wages vary according to success probability. In professions where many fail (like law), the successful few must earn enough to compensate for the unsuccessful many.\nWhile these five circumstances significantly impact labor wages, only two affect stock profits: the agreeableness of business and risk levels. Consequently, profit rates across different businesses tend to be more uniform than wage rates across occupations. The apparent differences in profit often stem from not properly distinguishing between wages and profits. For example, an apothecary's seemingly high profit margins may simply reflect reasonable wages for specialized knowledge disguised as profit. Similarly, a small grocer's high percentage profit often incorporates compensation for the grocer's labor and expertise.\nFor equality in the overall advantages and disadvantages of different employments, three conditions must exist: the employments must be well-established in the area, they must be in their ordinary or natural state rather than experiencing unusual demand fluctuations, and they must be the primary occupations of those engaged in them. Wages are typically higher in new trades than established ones since employers must initially attract workers with higher compensation. Trades subject to fashion changes often maintain higher wages than necessity-based industries with stable demand.\nMarket conditions also impact profits and wages temporarily. During harvest or wartime, wages rise with increased demand. Similarly, commodity price fluctuations affect profits, particularly for speculative merchants who attempt to buy when prices are likely to rise and sell when they might fall.\n", "map": [["Interest rates", "Merchant profit rates"], ["Disagreeableness of employment", "Higher wages"], ["Training cost and difficulty", "Wage premium"], ["Employment irregularity", "Wage compensation"], ["Trust requirements", "Professional wages"], ["Success probability", "Professional compensation"], ["Agreeableness of business", "Profit rates"], ["Business risk levels", "Profit compensation"], ["Apparent profit differences", "Disguised labor wages"], ["New trades", "Higher initial wages"], ["Fashion-dependent industries", "Wage stability premium"], ["Market demand fluctuations", "Temporary wage changes"], ["Commodity price variations", "Speculative merchant profits"]]}
