Whatever be the soil, climate, or extent of territory of any\r\nparticular nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must, in\r\nthat particular situation, depend upon those two circumstances.\r\n\n\r\nThe abundance or scantiness of this supply, too, seems to depend more upon the\r\nformer of those two circumstances than upon the latter. Among the savage\r\nnations of hunters and fishers, every individual who is able to work is more or\r\nless employed in useful labour, and endeavours to provide, as well as he can,\r\nthe necessaries and conveniencies of life, for himself, and such of his family\r\nor tribe as are either too old, or too young, or too infirm, to go a-hunting\r\nand fishing. Such nations, however, are so miserably poor, that, from mere\r\nwant, they are frequently reduced, or at least think themselves reduced, to the\r\nnecessity sometimes of directly destroying, and sometimes of abandoning their\r\ninfants, their old people, and those afflicted with lingering diseases, to\r\nperish with hunger, or to be devoured by wild beasts. Among civilized and\r\nthriving nations, on the contrary, though a great number of people do not\r\nlabour at all, many of whom consume the produce of ten times, frequently of a\r\nhundred times, more labour than the greater part of those who work; yet the\r\nproduce of the whole labour of the society is so great, that all are often\r\nabundantly supplied; and a workman, even of the lowest and poorest order, if he\r\nis frugal and industrious, may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and\r\nconveniencies of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.\r\n\n\r\nThe causes of this improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the\r\norder according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the\r\ndifferent ranks and conditions of men in the society, make the subject of the\r\nfirst book of this Inquiry.\r\n\n\r\nWhatever be the actual state of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which\r\nlabour is applied in any nation, the abundance or scantiness of its annual\r\nsupply must depend, during the continuance of that state, upon the proportion\r\nbetween the number of those who are annually employed in useful labour, and\r\nthat of those who are not so employed. The number of useful and productive\r\nlabourers, it will hereafter appear, is everywhere in proportion to the\r\nquantity of capital stock which is employed in setting them to work, and to the\r\nparticular way in which it is so employed. The second book, therefore, treats\r\nof the nature of capital stock, of the manner in which it is gradually\r\naccumulated, and of the different quantities of labour which it puts into\r\nmotion, according to the different ways in which it is employed.\r\n\n\r\nNations tolerably well advanced as to skill, dexterity, and judgment, in the\r\napplication of labour, have followed very different plans in the general\r\nconduct or direction of it; and those plans have not all been equally\r\nfavourable to the greatness of its produce. The policy of some nations has\r\ngiven extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the country; that of\r\nothers to the industry of towns. Scarce any nation has dealt equally and\r\nimpartially with every sort of industry. Since the down-fall of the Roman\r\nempire, the policy of Europe has been more favourable to arts, manufactures,\r\nand commerce, the industry of towns, than to agriculture, the Industry of the\r\ncountry. The circumstances which seem to have introduced and established this\r\npolicy are explained in the third book.\r\n\n\r\nThough those different plans were, perhaps, first introduced by the private\r\ninterests and prejudices of particular orders of men, without any regard to, or\r\nforesight of, their consequences upon the general welfare of the society; yet\r\nthey have given occasion to very different theories of political economy; of\r\nwhich some magnify the importance of that industry which is carried on in\r\ntowns, others of that which is carried on in the country. Those theories have\r\nhad a considerable influence, not only upon the opinions of men of learning,\r\nbut upon the public conduct of princes and sovereign states. I have\r\nendeavoured, in the fourth book, to explain as fully and distinctly as I can\r\nthose different theories, and the principal effects which they have produced in\r\ndifferent ages and nations.\r\n\n\r\nTo explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the people,\r\nor what has been the nature of those funds, which, in different ages and\r\nnations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of these four\r\nfirst books. The fifth and last book treats of the revenue of the sovereign, or\r\ncommonwealth. In this book I have endeavoured to shew, first, what are the\r\nnecessary expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth; which of those expenses\r\nought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society, and\r\nwhich of them, by that of some particular part only, or of some particular\r\nmembers of it: secondly, what are the different methods in which the whole\r\nsociety may be made to contribute towards defraying the expenses incumbent on\r\nthe whole society, and what are the principal advantages and inconveniencies of\r\neach of those methods; and, thirdly and lastly, what are the reasons and causes\r\nwhich have induced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this\r\nrevenue, or to contract debts; and what have been the effects of those debts\r\nupon the real wealth, the annual produce of the land and labour of the society.\r\n\n\r\nThe greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater\r\npart of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed,\r\nor applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour. The\r\neffects of the division of labour, in the general business of society, will be\r\nmore easily understood, by considering in what manner it operates in some\r\nparticular manufactures. It is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some\r\nvery trifling ones; not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than\r\nin others of more importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are\r\ndestined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole\r\nnumber of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every\r\ndifferent branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse,\r\nand placed at once under the view of the spectator.\r\n\n\r\nIn those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply the\r\ngreat wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of the work\r\nemploys so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to collect them all\r\ninto the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one time, than those\r\nemployed in one single branch. Though in such manufactures, therefore, the work\r\nmay really be divided into a much greater number of parts, than in those of a\r\nmore trifling nature, the division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly\r\nbeen much less observed.\r\n\n\r\nTo take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one in\r\nwhich the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the trade of\r\na pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the division of\r\nlabour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the use of the\r\nmachinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same division of labour\r\nhas probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry,\r\nmake one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty. But in the way in\r\nwhich this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar\r\ntrade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part\r\nare likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire; another straights it;\r\na third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving\r\nthe head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it\r\non is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\r\nitself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin\r\nis, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in\r\nsome manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the\r\nsame man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have seen a small\r\nmanufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed, and where some of\r\nthem consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they\r\nwere very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary\r\nmachinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about\r\ntwelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand\r\npins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them\r\nupwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a\r\ntenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\r\nthousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately\r\nand independently, and without any of them having been educated to this\r\npeculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty,\r\nperhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and\r\nfortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part of what they are\r\nat present capable of performing, in consequence of a proper division and\r\ncombination of their different operations.\r\n\n\r\nIn every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour are\r\nsimilar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of them,\r\nthe labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so great a\r\nsimplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far as it can be\r\nintroduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the\r\nproductive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments\r\nfrom one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage.\r\nThis separation, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which\r\nenjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one\r\nman, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved\r\none. In every improved society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer;\r\nthe manufacturer, nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is\r\nnecessary to produce any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided\r\namong a great number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each\r\nbranch of the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and\r\nthe wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\r\ndressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit of so\r\nmany subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one business\r\nfrom another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so entirely the\r\nbusiness of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the trade of the\r\ncarpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The spinner is almost\r\nalways a distinct person from the weaver; but the ploughman, the harrower, the\r\nsower of the seed, and the reaper of the corn, are often the same. The\r\noccasions for those different sorts of labour returning with the different\r\nseasons of the year, it is impossible that one man should be constantly\r\nemployed in any one of them. This impossibility of making so complete and\r\nentire a separation of all the different branches of labour employed in\r\nagriculture, is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers\r\nof labour, in this art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in\r\nmanufactures. The most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their\r\nneighbours in agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly\r\nmore distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\r\nlands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\r\nbestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\r\nfertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much more\r\nthan in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In agriculture,\r\nthe labour of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of\r\nthe poor; or, at least, it is never so much more productive, as it commonly is\r\nin manufactures. The corn of the rich country, therefore, will not always, in\r\nthe same degree of goodness, come cheaper to market than that of the poor. The\r\ncorn of Poland, in the same degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France,\r\nnotwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country.\r\nThe corn of France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years\r\nnearly about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\r\nimprovement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of England,\r\nhowever, are better cultivated than those of France, and the corn-lands of\r\nFrance are said to be much better cultivated than those of Poland. But though\r\nthe poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation, can, in\r\nsome measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn, it can\r\npretend to no such competition in its manufactures, at least if those\r\nmanufactures suit the soil, climate, and situation, of the rich country. The\r\nsilks of France are better and cheaper than those of England, because the silk\r\nmanufacture, at least under the present high duties upon the importation of raw\r\nsilk, does not so well suit the climate of England as that of France. But the\r\nhardware and the coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior\r\nto those of France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In\r\nPoland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\r\ncoarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\r\nsubsist.\r\n\n\r\nThis great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the\r\ndivision of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is\r\nowing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of dexterity in\r\nevery particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly\r\nlost in passing from one species of work to another; and, lastly, to the\r\ninvention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour,\r\nand enable one man to do the work of many.\r\n\n\r\nFirst, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily increases\r\nthe quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of labour, by\r\nreducing every man\u2019s business to some one simple operation, and by making\r\nthis operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily increases very much\r\nthe dexterity of the workman. A common smith, who, though accustomed to handle\r\nthe hammer, has never been used to make nails, if, upon some particular\r\noccasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will scarce, I am assured, be able to\r\nmake above two or three hundred nails in a day, and those, too, very bad ones.\r\nA smith who has been accustomed to make nails, but whose sole or principal\r\nbusiness has not been that of a nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence,\r\nmake more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several\r\nboys, under twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but\r\nthat of making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each\r\nof them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of a\r\nnail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same person\r\nblows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion, heats the\r\niron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head, too, he is\r\nobliged to change his tools. The different operations into which the making of\r\na pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of them much more simple,\r\nand the dexterity of the person, of whose life it has been the sole business to\r\nperform them, is usually much greater. The rapidity with which some of the\r\noperations of those manufactures are performed, exceeds what the human hand\r\ncould, by those who had never seen them, be supposed capable of acquiring.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in\r\npassing from one sort of work to another, is much greater than we should at\r\nfirst view be apt to imagine it. It is impossible to pass very quickly from one\r\nkind of work to another, that is carried on in a different place, and with\r\nquite different tools. A country weaver, who cultivates a small farm, must lose\r\na good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field, and from the field\r\nto his loom. When the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse, the\r\nloss of time is, no doubt, much less. It is, even in this case, however, very\r\nconsiderable. A man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one\r\nsort of employment to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom\r\nvery keen and hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some\r\ntime he rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering,\r\nand of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\r\nnecessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his\r\nwork and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty different\r\nways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always slothful and lazy,\r\nand incapable of any vigorous application, even on the most pressing occasions.\r\nIndependent, therefore, of his deficiency in point of dexterity, this cause\r\nalone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable\r\nof performing.\r\n\n\r\nThirdly, and lastly, everybody must be sensible how much labour is facilitated\r\nand abridged by the application of proper machinery. It is unnecessary to give\r\nany example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the invention of all those\r\nmachines by which labour is so much facilitated and abridged, seems to have\r\nbeen originally owing to the division of labour. Men are much more likely to\r\ndiscover easier and readier methods of attaining any object, when the whole\r\nattention of their minds is directed towards that single object, than when it\r\nis dissipated among a great variety of things. But, in consequence of the\r\ndivision of labour, the whole of every man\u2019s attention comes naturally to\r\nbe directed towards some one very simple object. It is naturally to be\r\nexpected, therefore, that some one or other of those who are employed in each\r\nparticular branch of labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of\r\nperforming their own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such\r\nimprovement. A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in\r\nwhich labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\r\nworkmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\r\nnaturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier methods\r\nof performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures,\r\nmust frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which were the inventions\r\nof such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part\r\nof the work. In the first fire engines {this was the current designation for\r\nsteam engines}, a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the\r\ncommunication between the boiler and the cylinder, according as the piston\r\neither ascended or descended. One of those boys, who loved to play with his\r\ncompanions, observed that, by tying a string from the handle of the valve which\r\nopened this communication to another part of the machine, the valve would open\r\nand shut without his assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself\r\nwith his play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\r\nthis machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the discovery of\r\na boy who wanted to save his own labour.\r\n\n\r\nAll the improvements in machinery, however, have by no means been the\r\ninventions of those who had occasion to use the machines. Many improvements\r\nhave been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines, when to make\r\nthem became the business of a peculiar trade; and some by that of those who are\r\ncalled philosophers, or men of speculation, whose trade it is not to do any\r\nthing, but to observe every thing, and who, upon that account, are often\r\ncapable of combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar\r\nobjects in the progress of society, philosophy or speculation becomes, like\r\nevery other employment, the principal or sole trade and occupation of a\r\nparticular class of citizens. Like every other employment, too, it is\r\nsubdivided into a great number of different branches, each of which affords\r\noccupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers; and this subdivision\r\nof employment in philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves\r\ndexterity, and saves time. Each individual becomes more expert in his own\r\npeculiar branch, more work is done upon the whole, and the quantity of science\r\nis considerably increased by it.\r\n\n\r\nIt is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts, in\r\nconsequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed\r\nsociety, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of\r\nthe people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of\r\nbeyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly\r\nin the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own\r\ngoods for a great quantity or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a\r\ngreat quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have\r\noccasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for,\r\nand a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the\r\nsociety.\r\n\n\r\nObserve the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a\r\ncivilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of\r\npeople, of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been employed in\r\nprocuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woollen coat,\r\nfor example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may\r\nappear, is the produce of the joint labour of a great multitude of workmen. The\r\nshepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the\r\nscribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others,\r\nmust all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely\r\nproduction. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must have been employed\r\nin transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often\r\nlive in a very distant part of the country? How much commerce and navigation in\r\nparticular, how many ship-builders, sailors, sail-makers, rope-makers, must\r\nhave been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of\r\nby the dyer, which often come from the remotest corners of the world? What a\r\nvariety of labour, too, is necessary in order to produce the tools of the\r\nmeanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such complicated machines as the\r\nship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or even the loom of the weaver, let\r\nus consider only what a variety of labour is requisite in order to form that\r\nvery simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The\r\nminer, the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of the\r\ntimber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the\r\nbrickmaker, the bricklayer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright,\r\nthe forger, the smith, must all of them join their different arts in order to\r\nproduce them. Were we to examine, in the same manner, all the different parts\r\nof his dress and household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears\r\nnext his skin, the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and\r\nall the different parts which compose it, the kitchen-grate at which he\r\nprepares his victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug\r\nfrom the bowels of the earth, and brought to him, perhaps, by a long sea and a\r\nlong land-carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of\r\nhis table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon which he\r\nserves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in preparing\r\nhis bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat and the light,\r\nand keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge and art requisite\r\nfor preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without which these northern\r\nparts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation,\r\ntogether with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing\r\nthose different conveniencies; if we examine, I say, all these things, and\r\nconsider what a variety of labour is employed about each of them, we shall be\r\nsensible that, without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the\r\nvery meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even\r\naccording to, what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which\r\nhe is commonly accommodated. Compared, indeed, with the more extravagant luxury\r\nof the great, his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy;\r\nand yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation of an European prince\r\ndoes not always so much exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant, as\r\nthe accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an African king, the\r\nabsolute masters of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages.\r\n\n\r\nThis division of labour, from which so many advantages are derived, is not\r\noriginally the effect of any human wisdom, which foresees and intends that\r\ngeneral opulence to which it gives occasion. It is the necessary, though very\r\nslow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature, which\r\nhas in view no such extensive utility; the propensity to truck, barter, and\r\nexchange one thing for another.\r\n\n\r\nWhether this propensity be one of those original principles in human nature, of\r\nwhich no further account can be given, or whether, as seems more probable, it\r\nbe the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason and speech, it belongs\r\nnot to our present subject to inquire. It is common to all men, and to be found\r\nin no other race of animals, which seem to know neither this nor any other\r\nspecies of contracts. Two greyhounds, in running down the same hare, have\r\nsometimes the appearance of acting in some sort of concert. Each turns her\r\ntowards his companion, or endeavours to intercept her when his companion turns\r\nher towards himself. This, however, is not the effect of any contract, but of\r\nthe accidental concurrence of their passions in the same object at that\r\nparticular time. Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of\r\none bone for another with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal, by its\r\ngestures and natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am\r\nwilling to give this for that. When an animal wants to obtain something either\r\nof a man, or of another animal, it has no other means of persuasion, but to\r\ngain the favour of those whose service it requires. A puppy fawns upon its dam,\r\nand a spaniel endeavours, by a thousand attractions, to engage the attention of\r\nits master who is at dinner, when it wants to be fed by him. Man sometimes uses\r\nthe same arts with his brethren, and when he has no other means of engaging\r\nthem to act according to his inclinations, endeavours by every servile and\r\nfawning attention to obtain their good will. He has not time, however, to do\r\nthis upon every occasion. In civilized society he stands at all times in need\r\nof the co-operation and assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is\r\nscarce sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons. In almost every\r\nother race of animals, each individual, when it is grown up to maturity, is\r\nentirely independent, and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance\r\nof no other living creature. But man has almost constant occasion for the help\r\nof his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence\r\nonly. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in\r\nhis favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what\r\nhe requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes\r\nto do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want,\r\nis the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain\r\nfrom one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in\r\nneed of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the\r\nbaker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\r\nWe address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never\r\ntalk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a\r\nbeggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens.\r\nEven a beggar does not depend upon it entirely. The charity of well-disposed\r\npeople, indeed, supplies him with the whole fund of his subsistence. But though\r\nthis principle ultimately provides him with all the necessaries of life which\r\nhe has occasion for, it neither does nor can provide him with them as he has\r\noccasion for them. The greater part of his occasional wants are supplied in the\r\nsame manner as those of other people, by treaty, by barter, and by purchase.\r\nWith the money which one man gives him he purchases food. The old clothes which\r\nanother bestows upon him he exchanges for other clothes which suit him better,\r\nor for lodging, or for food, or for money, with which he can buy either food,\r\nclothes, or lodging, as he has occasion.\r\n\n\r\nAs it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one another\r\nthe greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of, so it\r\nis this same trucking disposition which originally gives occasion to the\r\ndivision of labour. In a tribe of hunters or shepherds, a particular person\r\nmakes bows and arrows, for example, with more readiness and dexterity than any\r\nother. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison, with his\r\ncompanions; and he finds at last that he can, in this manner, get more cattle\r\nand venison, than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From a regard\r\nto his own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his\r\nchief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in making the\r\nframes and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to\r\nbe of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with\r\ncattle and with venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate\r\nhimself entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter.\r\nIn the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner or\r\ndresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And\r\nthus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the\r\nproduce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for\r\nsuch parts of the produce of other men\u2019s labour as he may have occasion\r\nfor, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to\r\ncultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent of genius he may possess for\r\nthat particular species of business.\r\n\n\r\nThe difference of natural talents in different men, is, in reality, much less\r\nthan we are aware of; and the very different genius which appears to\r\ndistinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is not\r\nupon many occasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour.\r\nThe difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher\r\nand a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from\r\nnature, as from habit, custom, and education. When they came in to the world,\r\nand for the first six or eight years of their existence, they were, perhaps,\r\nvery much alike, and neither their parents nor play-fellows could perceive any\r\nremarkable difference. About that age, or soon after, they come to be employed\r\nin very different occupations. The difference of talents comes then to be taken\r\nnotice of, and widens by degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is\r\nwilling to acknowledge scarce any resemblance. But without the disposition to\r\ntruck, barter, and exchange, every man must have procured to himself every\r\nnecessary and conveniency of life which he wanted. All must have had the same\r\nduties to perform, and the same work to do, and there could have been no such\r\ndifference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference\r\nof talents.\r\n\n\r\nAs it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents, so remarkable\r\namong men of different professions, so it is this same disposition which\r\nrenders that difference useful. Many tribes of animals, acknowledged to be all\r\nof the same species, derive from nature a much more remarkable distinction of\r\ngenius, than what, antecedent to custom and education, appears to take place\r\namong men. By nature a philosopher is not in genius and disposition half so\r\ndifferent from a street porter, as a mastiff is from a grey-hound, or a\r\ngrey-hound from a spaniel, or this last from a shepherd\u2019s dog. Those\r\ndifferent tribes of animals, however, though all of the same species are of\r\nscarce any use to one another. The strength of the mastiff is not in the least\r\nsupported either by the swiftness of the greyhound, or by the sagacity of the\r\nspaniel, or by the docility of the shepherd\u2019s dog. The effects of those\r\ndifferent geniuses and talents, for want of the power or disposition to barter\r\nand exchange, cannot be brought into a common stock, and do not in the least\r\ncontribute to the better accommodation and conveniency of the species. Each\r\nanimal is still obliged to support and defend itself, separately and\r\nindependently, and derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents\r\nwith which nature has distinguished its fellows. Among men, on the contrary,\r\nthe most dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another; the different produces\r\nof their respective talents, by the general disposition to truck, barter, and\r\nexchange, being brought, as it were, into a common stock, where every man may\r\npurchase whatever part of the produce of other men\u2019s talents he has\r\noccasion for.\r\n\n\r\nAs it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour,\r\nso the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that\r\npower, or, in other words, by the extent of the market. When the market is very\r\nsmall, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one\r\nemployment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the\r\nproduce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for\r\nsuch parts of the produce of other men\u2019s labour as he has occasion for.\r\n\n\r\nThere are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which can be carried\r\non nowhere but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find employment and\r\nsubsistence in no other place. A village is by much too narrow a sphere for\r\nhim; even an ordinary market-town is scarce large enough to afford him constant\r\noccupation. In the lone houses and very small villages which are scattered\r\nabout in so desert a country as the highlands of Scotland, every farmer must be\r\nbutcher, baker, and brewer, for his own family. In such situations we can\r\nscarce expect to find even a smith, a carpenter, or a mason, within less than\r\ntwenty miles of another of the same trade. The scattered families that live at\r\neight or ten miles distance from the nearest of them, must learn to perform\r\nthemselves a great number of little pieces of work, for which, in more populous\r\ncountries, they would call in the assistance of those workmen. Country workmen\r\nare almost everywhere obliged to apply themselves to all the different branches\r\nof industry that have so much affinity to one another as to be employed about\r\nthe same sort of materials. A country carpenter deals in every sort of work\r\nthat is made of wood; a country smith in every sort of work that is made of\r\niron. The former is not only a carpenter, but a joiner, a cabinet-maker, and\r\neven a carver in wood, as well as a wheel-wright, a plough-wright, a cart and\r\nwaggon-maker. The employments of the latter are still more various. It is\r\nimpossible there should be such a trade as even that of a nailer in the remote\r\nand inland parts of the highlands of Scotland. Such a workman at the rate of a\r\nthousand nails a-day, and three hundred working days in the year, will make\r\nthree hundred thousand nails in the year. But in such a situation it would be\r\nimpossible to dispose of one thousand, that is, of one day\u2019s work in the\r\nyear. As by means of water-carriage, a more extensive market is opened to every\r\nsort of industry than what land-carriage alone can afford it, so it is upon the\r\nsea-coast, and along the banks of navigable rivers, that industry of every kind\r\nnaturally begins to subdivide and improve itself, and it is frequently not till\r\na long time after that those improvements extend themselves to the inland parts\r\nof the country. A broad-wheeled waggon, attended by two men, and drawn by eight\r\nhorses, in about six weeks time, carries and brings back between London and\r\nEdinburgh near four ton weight of goods. In about the same time a ship\r\nnavigated by six or eight men, and sailing between the ports of London and\r\nLeith, frequently carries and brings back two hundred ton weight of goods. Six\r\nor eight men, therefore, by the help of water-carriage, can carry and bring\r\nback, in the same time, the same quantity of goods between London and Edinburgh\r\nas fifty broad-wheeled waggons, attended by a hundred men, and drawn by four\r\nhundred horses. Upon two hundred tons of goods, therefore, carried by the\r\ncheapest land-carriage from London to Edinburgh, there must be charged the\r\nmaintenance of a hundred men for three weeks, and both the maintenance and what\r\nis nearly equal to maintenance the wear and tear of four hundred horses, as\r\nwell as of fifty great waggons. Whereas, upon the same quantity of goods\r\ncarried by water, there is to be charged only the maintenance of six or eight\r\nmen, and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundred tons burthen, together with\r\nthe value of the superior risk, or the difference of the insurance between land\r\nand water-carriage. Were there no other communication between those two places,\r\ntherefore, but by land-carriage, as no goods could be transported from the one\r\nto the other, except such whose price was very considerable in proportion to\r\ntheir weight, they could carry on but a small part of that commerce which at\r\npresent subsists between them, and consequently could give but a small part of\r\nthat encouragement which they at present mutually afford to each other\u2019s\r\nindustry. There could be little or no commerce of any kind between the distant\r\nparts of the world. What goods could bear the expense of land-carriage between\r\nLondon and Calcutta? Or if there were any so precious as to be able to support\r\nthis expense, with what safety could they be transported through the\r\nterritories of so many barbarous nations? Those two cities, however, at present\r\ncarry on a very considerable commerce with each other, and by mutually\r\naffording a market, give a good deal of encouragement to each other\u2019s\r\nindustry.\r\n\n\r\nSince such, therefore, are the advantages of water-carriage, it is natural that\r\nthe first improvements of art and industry should be made where this\r\nconveniency opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every sort of\r\nlabour, and that they should always be much later in extending themselves into\r\nthe inland parts of the country. The inland parts of the country can for a long\r\ntime have no other market for the greater part of their goods, but the country\r\nwhich lies round about them, and separates them from the sea-coast, and the\r\ngreat navigable rivers. The extent of the market, therefore, must for a long\r\ntime be in proportion to the riches and populousness of that country, and\r\nconsequently their improvement must always be posterior to the improvement of\r\nthat country. In our North American colonies, the plantations have constantly\r\nfollowed either the sea-coast or the banks of the navigable rivers, and have\r\nscarce anywhere extended themselves to any considerable distance from both.\r\n\n\r\nThe nations that, according to the best authenticated history, appear to have\r\nbeen first civilized, were those that dwelt round the coast of the\r\nMediterranean sea. That sea, by far the greatest inlet that is known in the\r\nworld, having no tides, nor consequently any waves, except such as are caused\r\nby the wind only, was, by the smoothness of its surface, as well as by the\r\nmultitude of its islands, and the proximity of its neighbouring shores,\r\nextremely favourable to the infant navigation of the world; when, from their\r\nignorance of the compass, men were afraid to quit the view of the coast, and\r\nfrom the imperfection of the art of ship-building, to abandon themselves to the\r\nboisterous waves of the ocean. To pass beyond the pillars of Hercules, that is,\r\nto sail out of the straits of Gibraltar, was, in the ancient world, long\r\nconsidered as a most wonderful and dangerous exploit of navigation. It was late\r\nbefore even the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, the most skilful navigators and\r\nship-builders of those old times, attempted it; and they were, for a long time,\r\nthe only nations that did attempt it.\r\n\n\r\nOf all the countries on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, Egypt seems to have\r\nbeen the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were cultivated and\r\nimproved to any considerable degree. Upper Egypt extends itself nowhere above a\r\nfew miles from the Nile; and in Lower Egypt, that great river breaks itself\r\ninto many different canals, which, with the assistance of a little art, seem to\r\nhave afforded a communication by water-carriage, not only between all the great\r\ntowns, but between all the considerable villages, and even to many farm-houses\r\nin the country, nearly in the same manner as the Rhine and the Maese do in\r\nHolland at present. The extent and easiness of this inland navigation was\r\nprobably one of the principal causes of the early improvement of Egypt.\r\n\n\r\nThe improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have been of\r\nvery great antiquity in the provinces of Bengal, in the East Indies, and in\r\nsome of the eastern provinces of China, though the great extent of this\r\nantiquity is not authenticated by any histories of whose authority we, in this\r\npart of the world, are well assured. In Bengal, the Ganges, and several other\r\ngreat rivers, form a great number of navigable canals, in the same manner as\r\nthe Nile does in Egypt. In the eastern provinces of China, too, several great\r\nrivers form, by their different branches, a multitude of canals, and, by\r\ncommunicating with one another, afford an inland navigation much more extensive\r\nthan that either of the Nile or the Ganges, or, perhaps, than both of them put\r\ntogether. It is remarkable, that neither the ancient Egyptians, nor the\r\nIndians, nor the Chinese, encouraged foreign commerce, but seem all to have\r\nderived their great opulence from this inland navigation.\r\n\n\r\nAll the inland parts of Africa, and all that part of Asia which lies any\r\nconsiderable way north of the Euxine and Caspian seas, the ancient Scythia, the\r\nmodern Tartary and Siberia, seem, in all ages of the world, to have been in the\r\nsame barbarous and uncivilized state in which we find them at present. The sea\r\nof Tartary is the frozen ocean, which admits of no navigation; and though some\r\nof the greatest rivers in the world run through that country, they are at too\r\ngreat a distance from one another to carry commerce and communication through\r\nthe greater part of it. There are in Africa none of those great inlets, such as\r\nthe Baltic and Adriatic seas in Europe, the Mediterranean and Euxine seas in\r\nboth Europe and Asia, and the gulfs of Arabia, Persia, India, Bengal, and Siam,\r\nin Asia, to carry maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great\r\ncontinent; and the great rivers of Africa are at too great a distance from one\r\nanother to give occasion to any considerable inland navigation. The commerce,\r\nbesides, which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not break\r\nitself into any great number of branches or canals, and which runs into another\r\nterritory before it reaches the sea, can never be very considerable, because it\r\nis always in the power of the nations who possess that other territory to\r\nobstruct the communication between the upper country and the sea. The\r\nnavigation of the Danube is of very little use to the different states of\r\nBavaria, Austria, and Hungary, in comparison of what it would be, if any of\r\nthem possessed the whole of its course, till it falls into the Black sea.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is but a\r\nvery small part of a man\u2019s wants which the produce of his own labour can\r\nsupply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that surplus\r\npart of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own\r\nconsumption, for such parts of the produce of other men\u2019s labour as he\r\nhas occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some\r\nmeasure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a\r\ncommercial society.\r\n\n\r\nBut when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of\r\nexchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in its\r\noperations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity than he\r\nhimself has occasion for, while another has less. The former, consequently,\r\nwould be glad to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a part of this\r\nsuperfluity. But if this latter should chance to have nothing that the former\r\nstands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The butcher has more\r\nmeat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the brewer and the baker\r\nwould each of them be willing to purchase a part of it. But they have nothing\r\nto offer in exchange, except the different productions of their respective\r\ntrades, and the butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which\r\nhe has immediate occasion for. No exchange can, in this case, be made between\r\nthem. He cannot be their merchant, nor they his customers; and they are all of\r\nthem thus mutually less serviceable to one another. In order to avoid the\r\ninconveniency of such situations, every prudent man in every period of society,\r\nafter the first establishment of the division of labour, must naturally have\r\nendeavoured to manage his affairs in such a manner, as to have at all times by\r\nhim, besides the peculiar produce of his own industry, a certain quantity of\r\nsome one commodity or other, such as he imagined few people would be likely to\r\nrefuse in exchange for the produce of their industry. Many different\r\ncommodities, it is probable, were successively both thought of and employed for\r\nthis purpose. In the rude ages of society, cattle are said to have been the\r\ncommon instrument of commerce; and, though they must have been a most\r\ninconvenient one, yet, in old times, we find things were frequently valued\r\naccording to the number of cattle which had been given in exchange for them.\r\nThe armour of Diomede, says Homer, cost only nine oxen; but that of Glaucus\r\ncost a hundred oxen. Salt is said to be the common instrument of commerce and\r\nexchanges in Abyssinia; a species of shells in some parts of the coast of\r\nIndia; dried cod at Newfoundland; tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our\r\nWest India colonies; hides or dressed leather in some other countries; and\r\nthere is at this day a village in Scotland, where it is not uncommon, I am\r\ntold, for a workman to carry nails instead of money to the baker\u2019s shop\r\nor the ale-house.\r\n\n\r\nIn all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by\r\nirresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to metals\r\nabove every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as little loss as\r\nany other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable than they are, but\r\nthey can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of parts, as by\r\nfusion those parts can easily be re-united again; a quality which no other\r\nequally durable commodities possess, and which, more than any other quality,\r\nrenders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and circulation. The man who\r\nwanted to buy salt, for example, and had nothing but cattle to give in exchange\r\nfor it, must have been obliged to buy salt to the value of a whole ox, or a\r\nwhole sheep, at a time. He could seldom buy less than this, because what he was\r\nto give for it could seldom be divided without loss; and if he had a mind to\r\nbuy more, he must, for the same reasons, have been obliged to buy double or\r\ntriple the quantity, the value, to wit, of two or three oxen, or of two or\r\nthree sheep. If, on the contrary, instead of sheep or oxen, he had metals to\r\ngive in exchange for it, he could easily proportion the quantity of the metal\r\nto the precise quantity of the commodity which he had immediate occasion for.\r\n\n\r\nDifferent metals have been made use of by different nations for this purpose.\r\nIron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient Spartans, copper\r\namong the ancient Romans, and gold and silver among all rich and commercial\r\nnations.\r\n\n\r\nThose metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in rude\r\nbars, without any stamp or coinage. Thus we are told by Pliny (Plin. Hist Nat.\r\nlib. 33, cap. 3), upon the authority of Timaeus, an ancient historian, that,\r\ntill the time of Servius Tullius, the Romans had no coined money, but made use\r\nof unstamped bars of copper, to purchase whatever they had occasion for. These\r\nrude bars, therefore, performed at this time the function of money.\r\n\n\r\nThe use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very considerable\r\ninconveniences; first, with the trouble of weighing, and secondly, with that of\r\nassaying them. In the precious metals, where a small difference in the quantity\r\nmakes a great difference in the value, even the business of weighing, with\r\nproper exactness, requires at least very accurate weights and scales. The\r\nweighing of gold, in particular, is an operation of some nicety in the coarser\r\nmetals, indeed, where a small error would be of little consequence, less\r\naccuracy would, no doubt, be necessary. Yet we should find it excessively\r\ntroublesome if every time a poor man had occasion either to buy or sell a\r\nfarthing\u2019s worth of goods, he was obliged to weigh the farthing. The\r\noperation of assaying is still more difficult, still more tedious; and, unless\r\na part of the metal is fairly melted in the crucible, with proper dissolvents,\r\nany conclusion that can be drawn from it is extremely uncertain. Before the\r\ninstitution of coined money, however, unless they went through this tedious and\r\ndifficult operation, people must always have been liable to the grossest frauds\r\nand impositions; and instead of a pound weight of pure silver, or pure copper,\r\nmight receive, in exchange for their goods, an adulterated composition of the\r\ncoarsest and cheapest materials, which had, however, in their outward\r\nappearance, been made to resemble those metals. To prevent such abuses, to\r\nfacilitate exchanges, and thereby to encourage all sorts of industry and\r\ncommerce, it has been found necessary, in all countries that have made any\r\nconsiderable advances towards improvement, to affix a public stamp upon certain\r\nquantities of such particular metals, as were in those countries commonly made\r\nuse of to purchase goods. Hence the origin of coined money, and of those public\r\noffices called mints; institutions exactly of the same nature with those of the\r\naulnagers and stamp-masters of woollen and linen cloth. All of them are equally\r\nmeant to ascertain, by means of a public stamp, the quantity and uniform\r\ngoodness of those different commodities when brought to market.\r\n\n\r\nThe first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current metals,\r\nseem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain, what it was both most\r\ndifficult and most important to ascertain, the goodness or fineness of the\r\nmetal, and to have resembled the sterling mark which is at present affixed to\r\nplate and bars of silver, or the Spanish mark which is sometimes affixed to\r\ningots of gold, and which, being struck only upon one side of the piece, and\r\nnot covering the whole surface, ascertains the fineness, but not the weight of\r\nthe metal. Abraham weighs to Ephron the four hundred shekels of silver which he\r\nhad agreed to pay for the field of Machpelah. They are said, however, to be the\r\ncurrent money of the merchant, and yet are received by weight, and not by tale,\r\nin the same manner as ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present. The\r\nrevenues of the ancient Saxon kings of England are said to have been paid, not\r\nin money, but in kind, that is, in victuals and provisions of all sorts.\r\nWilliam the Conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money. This\r\nmoney, however, was for a long time, received at the exchequer, by weight, and\r\nnot by tale.\r\n\n\r\nThe inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness, gave\r\noccasion to the institution of coins, of which the stamp, covering entirely\r\nboth sides of the piece, and sometimes the edges too, was supposed to ascertain\r\nnot only the fineness, but the weight of the metal. Such coins, therefore, were\r\nreceived by tale, as at present, without the trouble of weighing.\r\n\n\r\nThe denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the weight\r\nor quantity of metal contained in them. In the time of Servius Tullius, who\r\nfirst coined money at Rome, the Roman as or pondo contained a Roman pound of\r\ngood copper. It was divided, in the same manner as our Troyes pound, into\r\ntwelve ounces, each of which contained a real ounce of good copper. The English\r\npound sterling, in the time of Edward I. contained a pound, Tower weight, of\r\nsilver of a known fineness. The Tower pound seems to have been something more\r\nthan the Roman pound, and something less than the Troyes pound. This last was\r\nnot introduced into the mint of England till the 18th of Henry the VIII. The\r\nFrench livre contained, in the time of Charlemagne, a pound, Troyes weight, of\r\nsilver of a known fineness. The fair of Troyes in Champaign was at that time\r\nfrequented by all the nations of Europe, and the weights and measures of so\r\nfamous a market were generally known and esteemed. The Scots money pound\r\ncontained, from the time of Alexander the First to that of Robert Bruce, a\r\npound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the English pound\r\nsterling. English, French, and Scots pennies, too, contained all of them\r\noriginally a real penny-weight of silver, the twentieth part of an ounce, and\r\nthe two hundred-and-fortieth part of a pound. The shilling, too, seems\r\noriginally to have been the denomination of a weight. \u201cWhen wheat is at\r\ntwelve shillings the quarter,\u201d says an ancient statute of Henry III.\r\n\u201cthen wastel bread of a farthing shall weigh eleven shillings and\r\nfourpence\u201d. The proportion, however, between the shilling, and either the\r\npenny on the one hand, or the pound on the other, seems not to have been so\r\nconstant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound. During the first\r\nrace of the kings of France, the French sou or shilling appears upon different\r\noccasions to have contained five, twelve, twenty, and forty pennies. Among the\r\nancient Saxons, a shilling appears at one time to have contained only five\r\npennies, and it is not improbable that it may have been as variable among them\r\nas among their neighbours, the ancient Franks. From the time of Charlemagne\r\namong the French, and from that of William the Conqueror among the English, the\r\nproportion between the pound, the shilling, and the penny, seems to have been\r\nuniformly the same as at present, though the value of each has been very\r\ndifferent; for in every country of the world, I believe, the avarice and\r\ninjustice of princes and sovereign states, abusing the confidence of their\r\nsubjects, have by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal, which had been\r\noriginally contained in their coins. The Roman as, in the latter ages of the\r\nrepublic, was reduced to the twenty-fourth part of its original value, and,\r\ninstead of weighing a pound, came to weigh only half an ounce. The English\r\npound and penny contain at present about a third only; the Scots pound and\r\npenny about a thirty-sixth; and the French pound and penny about a sixty-sixth\r\npart of their original value. By means of those operations, the princes and\r\nsovereign states which performed them were enabled, in appearance, to pay their\r\ndebts and fulfil their engagements with a smaller quantity of silver than would\r\notherwise have been requisite. It was indeed in appearance only; for their\r\ncreditors were really defrauded of a part of what was due to them. All other\r\ndebtors in the state were allowed the same privilege, and might pay with the\r\nsame nominal sum of the new and debased coin whatever they had borrowed in the\r\nold. Such operations, therefore, have always proved favourable to the debtor,\r\nand ruinous to the creditor, and have sometimes produced a greater and more\r\nuniversal revolution in the fortunes of private persons, than could have been\r\noccasioned by a very great public calamity.\r\n\n\r\nIt is in this manner that money has become, in all civilized nations, the\r\nuniversal instrument of commerce, by the intervention of which goods of all\r\nkinds are bought and sold, or exchanged for one another.\r\n\n\r\nWhat are the rules which men naturally observe, in exchanging them either for\r\nmoney, or for one another, I shall now proceed to examine. These rules\r\ndetermine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods.\r\n\n\r\nThe word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes\r\nexpresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of\r\npurchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may\r\nbe called \u2018value in use;\u2019 the other, \u2018value in\r\nexchange.\u2019 The things which have the greatest value in use have\r\nfrequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which\r\nhave the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.\r\nNothing is more useful than water; but it will purchase scarce any thing;\r\nscarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has\r\nscarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may\r\nfrequently be had in exchange for it.\r\n\n\r\nIn order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable value of\r\ncommodities, I shall endeavour to shew,\r\n\n\r\nFirst, what is the real measure of this exchangeable value; or wherein consists\r\nthe real price of all commodities.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly, what are the different parts of which this real price is composed or\r\nmade up.\r\n\n\r\nAnd, lastly, what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise some or\r\nall of these different parts of price above, and sometimes sink them below,\r\ntheir natural or ordinary rate; or, what are the causes which sometimes hinder\r\nthe market price, that is, the actual price of commodities, from coinciding\r\nexactly with what may be called their natural price.\r\n\n\r\nI shall endeavour to explain, as fully and distinctly as I can, those three\r\nsubjects in the three following chapters, for which I must very earnestly\r\nentreat both the patience and attention of the reader: his patience, in order\r\nto examine a detail which may, perhaps, in some places, appear unnecessarily\r\ntedious; and his attention, in order to understand what may perhaps, after the\r\nfullest explication which I am capable of giving it, appear still in some\r\ndegree obscure. I am always willing to run some hazard of being tedious, in\r\norder to be sure that I am perspicuous; and, after taking the utmost pains that\r\nI can to be perspicuous, some obscurity may still appear to remain upon a\r\nsubject, in its own nature extremely abstracted.\r\n\n\r\nEvery man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to\r\nenjoy the necessaries, conveniencies, and amusements of human life. But after\r\nthe division of labour has once thoroughly taken place, it is but a very small\r\npart of these with which a man\u2019s own labour can supply him. The far\r\ngreater part of them he must derive from the labour of other people, and he\r\nmust be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labour which he can\r\ncommand, or which he can afford to purchase. The value of any commodity,\r\ntherefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume\r\nit himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity\r\nof labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the\r\nreal measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.\r\n\n\r\nThe real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who\r\nwants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing\r\nis really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants to dispose of it,\r\nor exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to\r\nhimself, and which it can impose upon other people. What is bought with money,\r\nor with goods, is purchased by labour, as much as what we acquire by the toil\r\nof our own body. That money, or those goods, indeed, save us this toil. They\r\ncontain the value of a certain quantity of labour, which we exchange for what\r\nis supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labour was\r\nthe first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things. It\r\nwas not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world\r\nwas originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want\r\nto exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of\r\nlabour which it can enable them to purchase or command.\r\n\n\r\nWealth, as Mr Hobbes says, is power. But the person who either acquires, or\r\nsucceeds to a great fortune, does not necessarily acquire or succeed to any\r\npolitical power, either civil or military. His fortune may, perhaps, afford him\r\nthe means of acquiring both; but the mere possession of that fortune does not\r\nnecessarily convey to him either. The power which that possession immediately\r\nand directly conveys to him, is the power of purchasing a certain command over\r\nall the labour, or over all the produce of labour which is then in the market.\r\nHis fortune is greater or less, precisely in proportion to the extent of this\r\npower, or to the quantity either of other men\u2019s labour, or, what is the\r\nsame thing, of the produce of other men\u2019s labour, which it enables him to\r\npurchase or command", "summary": "\nThis text presents fundamental principles of political economy from Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations.\" Smith begins by establishing that a nation's prosperity depends on its annual labor, which supplies all necessities and conveniences. This prosperity is determined by two factors: the skill with which labor is applied and the proportion of the population engaged in useful work. Of these, Smith asserts that skill is more important than mere numbers.\nSmith examines how the division of labor dramatically increases productivity. Using the example of pin manufacturing, he shows how breaking production into specialized tasks allows workers to produce exponentially more than they could individually. This division creates three advantages: increased dexterity through specialization, time savings from not switching between tasks, and innovation of labor-saving machinery. When workers focus on specific operations, they naturally discover improvements and efficiencies. Even simple inventions, like a boy's mechanism to automate steam engine valve operation, arise from this specialization.\nThe division of labor creates universal wealth by enabling each person to exchange their surplus production. Smith observes that even a common laborer's coat represents the combined work of countless specialized workers\u2014from shepherds and weavers to miners and toolmakers. This interconnected production allows even ordinary citizens in civilized nations to enjoy comforts beyond what any independent \"savage\" could obtain alone.\nThis system arises not from deliberate design but from humanity's natural propensity to \"truck, barter, and exchange.\" Unlike animals, humans negotiate mutually beneficial trades. Smith notes that people rarely obtain what they need through benevolence alone but through appealing to others' self-interest: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\"\nThe extent of market limits the division of labor. In isolated areas, individuals must perform many functions, while dense populations allow for greater specialization. Water transportation dramatically expands markets, explaining why early civilizations developed along coasts and navigable rivers. Smith notes that ancient Egypt, with the Nile's transportation network, developed agriculture and manufacturing early, as did areas along the Ganges and in China.\nAs division of labor increases, direct bartering becomes problematic\u2014one may have goods to sell when others have nothing desirable to exchange. This challenge led to the development of money. Smith traces how various commodities served as exchange mediums until metals became preferred for their durability and divisibility. Eventually, coins with standard weights and fineness emerged to facilitate trade.\nSmith distinguishes between \"value in use\" (utility) and \"value in exchange\" (purchasing power), noting that essentials like water have high use value but low exchange value, while diamonds have the opposite. Labor, he concludes, is the true measure of value\u2014the real price of anything is the toil required to obtain it. Wealth is therefore power\u2014not political power, but the power to command the labor of others through exchange. A person's fortune is precisely proportional to how much of others' labor they can purchase.\n", "map": [["National Prosperity", "Annual Labor Output"], ["Annual Labor Output", "Skill of Labor"], ["Annual Labor Output", "Proportion of Useful Workers"], ["Division of Labor", "Increased Productivity"], ["Increased Productivity", "Specialized Skill Development"], ["Increased Productivity", "Time Savings"], ["Increased Productivity", "Innovation of Machinery"], ["Division of Labor", "Universal Wealth Creation"], ["Universal Wealth Creation", "Exchange of Surplus Production"], ["Human Propensity to Exchange", "Division of Labor"], ["Human Propensity to Exchange", "Self-Interest Drives Markets"], ["Self-Interest Drives Markets", "Mutual Benefit Not Benevolence"], ["Market Size", "Division of Labor"], ["Market Size", "Transportation Networks"], ["Transportation Networks", "Civilization Development Patterns"], ["Barter Limitations", "Money Development"], ["Money Development", "Metal Currency Evolution"], ["Labor as True Value Measure", "Command of Others' Labor"], ["Command of Others' Labor", "Personal Fortune Proportional Power"]]}
